While there might be countless dimensions, we are going to focus on four key indicators; respect, integrity, compassion, and excellence. The dimension of respect in this context is defined as the regard and mutual respect that the leader is perceived as showing their direct reports. The dimension of integrity in leadership can be defined as the exhibition of honesty and ethical behaviors shown to the team. The dimension of compassion in leadership can be defined as showing consideration for the well-being of the people on their team. Put another way, it is recognizing the priority of the individual's state of mind over the work to be done. Finally, the dimension of excellence in leadership can be defined as the commitment to exhibit the same high quality of work that they expect from their team. In this context high quality of work means efforts completed on time, within budget and relatively free of errors.\nSeveral of these dimensions are inter-related to each other. For example, if a leader exhibits compassion for their employees, then they will be more likely to also exhibit respect for them. On the converse side, they may have to have courageous conversations holding their team accountable (if they are under performing) while still exhibiting respect for them. These four indicators need to be balanced between the good of the team and the good of the company. Without the company, they would not have a job and without the team the company would not be able to accomplish their goals.\nLeaders will need to adapt their leadership styles to accommodate and support the varied cultures and backgrounds of their team. Taking the time to onboard new employees and getting to know them through informal conversations will go a long way to understand their perceptions in the context of work. \nBecause great leaders are always seeking and open to feedback, this concept is truly a dynamic feedback loop in which the leader wants to serve the team better by understanding the team's suggestions and concerns. This study truly just touches on four of many aspects of effective leadership.\n", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697687780437, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "6514e906f1bc67107c90bf06", "uid": "DgLjd349U3M5DyItNQDiHqk6ahM2", "email": "angelee1@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1695869190688, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Angie Vogel", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

It is\nthe source of thought and emotion. It obtains and holds memories. It\ndelivers sensations to the body. Sensations deliver feedback to the brain.\nConsciousness is also the source of creativity (or the lack thereof) and\nproblem solving. It is responsible for mental states of being.\nAwareness is a perception.\nPerception is a cognitive process that is also linked to our thoughts,\nbeliefs, and expectations.\nSelf is the unique human you are. Self has an ever changing state, every\nthought, sensation, memory, perception, and awareness changes the self.\nThoughts are ideas and a way to process information.\nMemories are thoughts about things that happened in the past. They are\nhelpful to remember in order to avoid making the same mistakes more\nthan once and learning from our past experiences. They contain emotions\nand desires. They influence our decision making process. They contribute\nto making you who you are.\nSensations are physical and emotional experiences that are deeply tied to\nthe experience of awareness. They bring all the raw data to the brain.\nThe brain is the source of consciousness.\n\nFor all of these experiments I would draw from at least 50 individuals from\ndifferent backgrounds, communities, and ages.\nThe Mirror Test: In this test I would place a sticker on the participant\u2019s\nforehead where they can't feel it. I would show them their own face in a\nmirror. I can know they have a sense of self if they try to touch the mark. I\ncan ascertain they don't recognize themself if they don't reach for the dot.\nThis can indicate self-awareness. I would need to get consent from the\nparticipant for all aspects of the experiment. I don't know if there's a way\nto retest this for reliability.\nFor the shapes test: I would place the participant in a room alone with a\ncomputer screen and a controller and a set of headphones on. From a\ndifferent room I would tell them to select a specific shape and record\nwhether or not they chose the correct shape. In my quest to limit bias I\nwould offer the test in as many different languages as possible and keep\nthe age range wide (while categorizing both of those considerations). Testretest would be a good way to check for reliability in this test.\nFor the memory test: I would ask a series of questions about participants'\nunique experiences as a child and have them rate these memories as\nvery positive, positive, neither positive nor negative, negative, and\nstrongly negative. This might indicate problems with long term memory\nloss or otherwise. Other questions could be combined to make this a more\nrobust examination such as asking them more concrete questions like\ntheir childhood address, phone number, or school names. Memories are\nan important aspect of consciousness because they help us know who we\nare and what we are doing in our lives.\nI would run an MRI scan while showing participants a series of pictures\nand see which, if any, parts of their brain light up. Afterwards we could talk\nabout the way each picture made them feel and I could compare that\nqualitative data with the quantitative data. I would partner with experts to\nfind out how I could compare that data to the quantitative variables I\nobtain through the interviews.\nI conceptualize consciousness to be an awareness of self and the\ncapacity to interpret the world around oneself.

The mirror test was the first thing that came to mind just because it's something that I have thought of in the past. I wasn't sure how effective it would be on a person just because I think most people would know themselves. However, there are some neurological conditions, like prosopagnosia, which make it very difficult for a person to recognize faces. I have prosopagnosia and I have a difficult time identifying my own face, like in pictures and things like that. So, I don't know. I still would have thought, \"Hey, I'm in a mirror. That's probably a dot on my forehead\". But, I don't know if maybe somebody wouldn't, and if they didn't that sense of self would be missing. It just seemed like an easy place to start.\n\nMoving on to the shapes test, I thought it was just a way to find out if somebody can cognitively identify things that are not part of themselves. Things that are easy to identify would allow you to observe a person understanding something that's outside of them.\n\nRegarding the potential bias in the mirror test again, I'm unsure if there is much potential bias there. I did have a difficult time coming up with a way to explore or create the mirror test without sedating a person, misleading them, or figuring out how to put a dot on someone's forehead without them knowing it was done.\n\nAlso, in terms of bias in the shapes test, I feel there would be challenges when it came to age and language barriers. I don't know if education really factors into whether you can tell what a circle is, or a square, but it depends on how complicated the shapes would be. If we're talking about hexagons and octagons, which I wasn't considering, I was considering elementary shapes i.e. square, triangle, circle, oval, diamond, then that could potentially bias the test.\n\nI want to figure out a way to make sure that I am including all different sorts of people in these studies, so that part is tricky."}, {"conversation_id": "6531abbfa275536b0445367a", "question": "I appreciate your thoughtful response, Kat, and your considerations for potential bias in your proposed tests.

With freedom comes the ability to improve one's health, status, intelligence, and individuality as they please. It is essential to a living being.\n\nI would first do a pilot study on a smaller sample, and ask for feedback regarding what might have altered subject's answers or made them uncomfortable in order to maximize methodology rigor. Any and all alterations required to ensure the study's ethical and procedural quality discovered in the pilot study would be incorporated in the study itself. I would be sure to document any changes carefully and incorporate them effectively into the research process to ensure transparency and consistency. Before each interview (pilot and first trial) I would outline who will have access to the data tied to their name (myself and other researchers only), that they will remain totally anonymous, and that they would be contacted if anything regarding the study or its results changes. This would be in the form of a uniform speech and waiver that outlines exactly where their data will go, and who will see it. I would ensure that the uniform speech and waiver effectively communicate privacy policies clearly and comprehensively to all participants. I would also explain that I would be looking for a representative number of people from each identity category to represent the city of Seattle. Then, I would take a sample ratio representing the demographics of Seattle and interview them in person. For example, I would interview 40% men, 40% women, and 20% nonbinary people if that were how the gender identity demographic of Seattle was situated. I would also remain open to shifting my sampling process to in relation to issues of identity and intersectionality. I would do this process in considering race, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, geographic location and nationality as accurately as possible (in relation to how much each identity makes upon the population), in order to create an accurate sample of people in the city, and how much of the city they make up (this would shift if needed due to unforeseen complexities regarding identity and intersectionality). If and when these identities overlap, I would count each person as one vote for each segment of their identity. After the study, I would hold a debrief with scientists and non-scientists of all identities represented in the survey and do a post-test, asking if any feedback should be considered, keeping all data anonymous. Any and all considerations discovered in the debrief will be considered in the interpretations of the data when finding results. All researchers will look for potential bias in themselves and their colleagues throughout the interpretation process to ensure the most fair, and uninhibited results. After the debrief, I would conduct another study using the data collected in the first. I would search for correlations between certain kinds of intersectionality, and how free people of those intersections feel. Any interpretation of this data to find correlations would be done in an exact and predetermined manner with careful consideration and meticulous attention to detail to any innate or unconscious bias of participants and observers to ensure accurate and sensitive results.", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697754688517, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "651df00e420f21c19a6e8b10", "uid": "xiADJ1fh2dMmCq0ZXiLBBU9EDU12", "email": "willful1@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1696460814600, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "William Crockett", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

These ways are the three basic mechanisms, I believe, that humans use to navigate through the physical world. If you are physically restricted, like being in a jail cell or in handcuffs, you're not free. Emotional freedom is not exactly how I would phrase it, but it deals with how you feel. Some people have their emotional responses restricted or others attempt to restrict them in the sense of \"Oh, you can't feel empathy for the enemy,\" or whoever else any institutional force wants you to feel. Thus, to be able to feel freely means to be able to experience any natural emotions without any pressure to feel otherwise. Freedom of thought allows you to think without constraints. That's more of a conceptual idea prevalent in works like \"Nineteen Eighty-Four.\" I believe these are the three ways that we exist in this physical and non-physical world.

Creativity may build upon, transform, or combine in new ways existing ideas in new and/or unexpected ways. New would be not previously existing, innovative would be methods that are not currently common or expected, or adapting/combining existing methods in new ways, and original would mean occurring as a direct result of one's own or collaborative work that creates or builds upon existing concepts. Creativity stems from imagination, thinking beyond boundaries, considering new perspectives, and being open to unconventional ideas. Creativity is also subjective; what may be creative to one person or group may not be considered creative to another.\n\nOperationalization: I would assign a group of design students to creatively improve an everyday item, for example, a backpack. At the conclusion of the project, I would ask the following survey questions. \n1. What improvements did you make and how did you decide on each one?\n2. Were your improvements based on something you have previously seen, or did they stem from your imagination?\n3. Would you consider your improvements unconventional? Why?\n4. On a scale of 1-5, how unexpected would you rate your design? Why? \n5. Has your design been done before? If so, how did you improve or transform it? \n6. What makes your design different from that of others?\n7. On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your own creativity? Why?\n8. On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate the uniqueness of your design? Why? Did you notice similar designs in the group? \n9. On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate the practicality of your design? Did practicality influence or hinder your creative decisions? \n10. Had practicality not been a consideration, what would you have done differently? \nSince creativity is subjective, I opted for open-ended questions that allow the designer to express how they view their own creativity. If they are able to express how they believe their design is creative, then by their subjective standards it may be creative even if it is not immediately seen as so by the researcher. \nAt the conclusion of the study, I would conduct a comparative analysis of the answers given by both groups to determine how creativity was enhanced/stunted by the use of influential materials in comparison to imagination. \nSince the questions I have chosen are not technically specific to the project, I would consider pilot testing them in a more informal setting such as with a similar project assigned as a classroom assignment where the survey responses have no effect on the students' grades. \nI would assign a group of design students to creatively improve an everyday item, for example, a backpack. One group would be given existing designs, complaints and suggested improvements on suggested designs, and previous trials. The second group would be given nothing and have to work with only their imagination. Both groups would then be asked the same set of questions to determine how they used their own creativity rather than relying on others' work. I would measure creativity by how much each group thought outside the box and made design improvements in new and unexpected ways as noted in the questions.

However, it doesn't know everything; it merely draws on information provided by others. Despite this, it improved the quality of my answers by bringing new aspects to my attention. In terms of reliability, it doesn't create information, it just presents existing information. This could potentially harm reliability as chatbots aren't always accurate or fully understanding. However, it did enhance the quality of my responses by highlighting gaps in my knowledge, which I found very beneficial. I enjoyed using it; its level of understanding was surprisingly high. However, relying on it entirely could hamper its reliability, because it may not fully comprehend everything. Also, the chatbot I used, GPT, I believe its most recent information is from 2021, so it might not always be up-to-date.

Equity, on the other hand, would involve giving each student a desk suitably fitted to their height, recognizing their different needs. \n\nBeyond this hypothesis, I also considered issues around college admissions. Equality would mean evaluating all applicants identically, but I question whether this is fair. Some students may face more adversity during their upbringing or during their application process. In this case, I believe that equity suggests admissions should account for disparate opportunities and challenges. \n\nThis resonated with my sense of justice because it ensures more equal outcomes rather than identical processes.

Thus, equity necessitates dismantling systematic barriers that prevent equal access, treatment, and outcomes for all individuals, regardless of their identities or circumstances.

Wisdom is knowledge that someone can have that they can share with other people. Knowledge is information that a person has retained and collected that they then can apply in a way that is insightful using good judgment. Experience is understood to have to do with time doing a job or duty but should also the quality and ability to reflect upon that experience. Success can be described as reaching a goal, growing as a person, and being a positive force on others. The ability to communicate and share with others what insights you have gathered and lessons learned that can help others in their lives.\n\nOperational: To operationalize my concept of wisdom I can conduct an experiment where I ask people to fill out a questionnaire where I have sample scenarios in which it test the wisdom of the participants by asking what they would do . Then I can have a short test that touches upon ethical dilemmas, life situations and hard decisions that should bring out a persons wisdom. After that can be a survey dealing with experience that can then ask people their age, their profession and how long they have been working. Included in that survey would also be an open ended question asking to describe a challenging situation at work or in their lives and how the dealt with it.  Next would be a questionnaire that ask people if they feel that having \"success\" is more essential to growth or \"success and failures\" with a section that asks why they chose that.  The last dimension to be studied would be that of communication, here I can a listen and share exercise where participants listen to a story and then retell it to me where I write down how accurate their statement is. \nAs for conducting the operationalization of this concept. I will team up with a university to conduct a data collection experiment, where we follow all aspects of respect for persons and informed consent. We would ask people around campus (including students, professors and other staff at the university) to participate and then have them meet with us to be given this questionnaire.  \n\n", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697829693858, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "6528460bdfcf3b9f5ab4e61f", "uid": "J4QCeCvzHgRjPCQlzyPnAlpLCQx1", "email": "cras.arizo@gmail.com", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1697138187189, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Aaron Joseph Rizo", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

From these responses, we could gauge their wisdom by the choices they made. \n\nAnother topic was 'success and failure', which I believe plays a key role in developing wisdom. I would ask them whether they view success as better than failure, or if failure could be equally beneficial, if not more. This would be followed by an open-ended question that would allow them to explain their perspective. \n\nOther factors like experience, age, and workplace were also considered. I contemplated including an open-ended question to get an account of a challenging situation they faced, either at work or elsewhere, and how they managed. \n\nSince human participants were involved, ensuring informed consent was another essential aspect. I decided to partner with a university to adhere to strict regulations, such as those mandated by the IRB board. \n\nThe concept of wisdom and its testing through variables like knowledge, experience, success, failure, and communication was my primary focus. I first thought of an email test but quickly realized that there would be several variables involved. So, I then devised a listening and retelling task where participants would listen to a story through headphones and then retell it. This way, I could assess their understanding by noting key details conveyed or missed in their retelling. \n\nIn sum, these were key components of my unique approach to studying wisdom."}, {"conversation_id": "6532d33da275536b0445389d", "question": "That's a thorough explanation, Aaron.

For example, when you consider someone wise, what characteristics are you looking for? What makes you feel like this person knows a lot and that you should talk to them, or hope they talk to you to share their knowledge?\n\nThe first criterion I considered was knowledge, or intelligence if you prefer. This forms the first dimension of wisdom. Secondly, I think wisdom is closely related to experience because you only acquire significant knowledge through varied experiences. Through this, you've likely had a lot of success and failures from which you can learn.

I view this as a sign that trusted entities will communicate and behave in an open, transparent, and sincere manner, free from deceit and secrecy. \n\nThe third dimension, loyalty, to me represents an unwavering commitment amongst the parties or individuals involved, usually within the confines of relationships. \n\nI consciously recognized that these three dimensions are tightly interconnected, and when defining them, I've tried to present them as closely linked to what shapes trust based on my understanding and past experiences. \n\nBut as I delve into the operational phase, I am surprised by how my interpretation evolves during the process. I noticed that as I revised my survey questions, I developed a deeper understanding of the meanings of reliability, honesty, and loyalty, which in turn contributed to enhancing the broader concept of trust. \n\nThese elements seemed more interdependent in this phase, each presenting a different perspective on how trust can be built. I found this process of breaking down the dimensions to be highly beneficial for building a foundation and for cultivating a more comprehensive understanding of the whole concept. \n\nAs I delved deeper into the operational phase, I learned more about how each term functions, which has helped to define the core idea of trust, creating a clearer understanding of how each aspect can support the overall concept of trust."}, {"conversation_id": "6532e6c7a275536b044538c7", "question": "Xiaofeng, your reflections on how the dimensions of trust evolved in your understanding is very insightful.

One of the first things I did was find out the concept or the meaning of trust. I began to think, \"What does trust mean to me in my personal life?\" I contemplated different scenarios where I was either trusted, trusting someone else, mistrusting others, or doubting their truthfulness. These situations helped me really understand what the concept of trust means to me. \n\nAfter developing my original concept of trust, I started to analyze the factors or reasons that make me feel trusted or untrusted. I began with reliability. This term resonates with me because if you are trusted, it means you can rely on someone or that you are considered reliable. Therefore, reliability is a key term in my conceptual definition of trust. \n\nThe second term I considered is honesty. I believe being honest and transparent is crucial to being trusted. For instance, if someone wishes to gain your trust, they would typically be more transparent rather than deceitful. If we perceive that someone is lying to us, we are more likely to distrust them. \n\nLoyalty is the final concept I considered. Within a relationship, like the one I have with my boyfriend, I trust him because he gives me a sense of loyalty. His commitment to me makes me feel that he is reliable and trustworthy. \n\nIn summary, my understanding of trust is shaped by three key concepts: reliability, honesty, and loyalty."}, {"conversation_id": "6532e6c7a275536b044538c7", "question": "It sounds like personal experiences and relationships played a big role in shaping your understanding of trust, Xiaofeng.

I've been considering how I should conduct my operational research and what kind of questions I want to delve into. One aspect I've considered is trust in a relationship. What sorts of elements to look for, or what approach would best determine if a person truly trusts their partner. \n\nIn my experience, people often trust those they are closest to the most. With this in mind, I designed an initial survey question that was intended to gauge the participant's overall trustworthiness. This was measured by two main factors: trust and distrust.\n\nFollowing feedback from AI chatbot \"GPT-L\", a tool that I've been utilizing, I began considering how I could further refine my questions so they would provide more meaningful insights. In conducting a survey, it's not only about asking if a respondent trusts someone. It's also important to explore different dimensions of trust, examining how it works in various scenarios. \n\nFor example, one of my questions addressed the participant's overall trust towards close relatives or friends, offering a scale from one to five. I thought this range would be broad enough to measure whether they felt generally mistrusted or completely trusted. \n\nI also explored distrust because I believe it's crucial to test this aspect as well. Based on previous research, we've found that confronting this aspect directly can improve our understanding of the survey results we gather. \n\nMoreover, I also delved into the concept of reliability. Specifically, I sought to investigate how respondents regarded individuals who were reliable in terms of keeping their promises. Instead of using the word 'trust', I chose the term 'rely' as I believed it was a more easily understood metric for measuring behavior within the given scenario. \n\nI also posed questions about honesty, asking respondents to rate the honesty of their close relations, regarding the sharing of personal concerns. This was motivated by my personal experiences, where I've found honesty to be about sharing private matters and having them handled with respect. \n\nLastly, I explored the concept of loyalty by asking respondents about their confidence in their closest relations remaining transparent and supportive even when faced with pressure or challenges. From personal experience, I've found that this is what loyalty embodies.\n\nEach question may seem to address a different dimension, but they all revolve around the central theme of 'trust'. This was deliberately done to stimulate respondents to think about different scenarios, all which revolve around trust."}, {"conversation_id": "6532e6c7a275536b044538c7", "question": "I appreciate your detailed response, Xiaofeng, especially how you used personal experiences to formulate your survey questions.

So then, I started wondering, when I want to learn more about people's feelings and attitudes, what is the best approach? I thought about conducting interviews based on a survey I designed. So, for instance, if I have a particular question in mind, I can use it to develop detailed follow-up questions. \n\nLet's look at the last question in my survey: \"On a scale of one to five, how confident are you that individuals in your closest relationships will remain transparent and stand by you even when faced with external pressures and challenges?\" More detailed or follow-up questions could be: \"Can you explain more about the feeling of trust in your relationship? What is the emotional or psychological experience of feeling loyalty from someone standing by you? How does that enhance or weaken your trust in that person? If you were faced with a similar situation in the future, what feelings or reactions do you expect to have?\" These are some questions that I may consider as follow-ups to help me further develop the conceptual and operational definitions. I think it would truly help me to better understand what drives or influences these factors. \n\nAs for the second question, \"How to ensure the validity and reliability of the operational definitions within the survey?\" \u2013 you definitely want to consider it from two perspectives. Firstly, how can it be broad enough to include people from different demographics? When I conducted the research, I focused primarily on the 20 to 45 age group because I believe they not only have maturity in their relationships and understand them better, but they also have more life experience. Secondly, it's essential to ensure that the survey is conducted ethically and the questions used are relatable and helpful for participants.

Starting with the first one: \"Can you share more about how interviews could validate or adjust your operational definitions?\" In response, I started to ponder what predictable outcomes studies in the current industry might have produced. This led me to consider what the assumed conclusion may be in relation to my job. We tend to assume that the answer could be either evenly balanced or weighted differently, with one aspect carrying more significance than the other. Therefore, I began to consider what results I wished to derive. However, it was paramount that I did not infuse my subjective opinions or biases into this process, as I aimed to ensure the findings were objective, scientific, and reliable. \n\nThis necessitates validating the studies multiple times through interviews and expanding my observational group by interviewing different people. This would improve the efficiency and accuracy of the research. Keeping in line with what I mentioned earlier, the question must be accurate and consistent. When I mentioned loyalty, I thought it should be developed further to explore core themes related to trust that could be identified in the questions. \n\nAn example of a question I could ask is, \"What is your current experience with feeling a strong sense of loyalty and safety, as if someone is standing beside you in your relationships?\" This query might help me comprehend that trust signifies being loyal to others. I want to understand if a good relationship means having loyal friendships or partnerships, and if so, how loyalty is manifested in real life. \n\nFor the second question, I think it's excellent and might reshape my definition of trust. Every word has its own research scope; for example, honesty can imply behavioral or physical honesty. While loyalty can also have a diverse range. While conducting research, different people will invariably interpret the word differently, though trust remains the central focus of the research. Even if the research might diverge a bit from loyalty, The aim is not to ask questions that stray away from the concept of trust but to guide individuals to consider how loyal behaviors contribute to the idea of trust."}, {"conversation_id": "6532e6c7a275536b044538c7", "question": "Xiaofeng, your idea of using responses from interviews to refine your definitions is intuitive.

The question that makes me most uncomfortable is when I am asked if the feedback was satisfactory and whether the YouChat chatbot helped me validate and construct my questions well. Generally, the feedback is quite positive. However, it is not fully constructive, which leads me to consider whether AI might only be generating the negative words, without fully explaining all the scenarios in life. Even though AI enhances some understanding, it only accounts for part of it. I have pondered using a chatbot for further research. Interestingly, it has helped to some extent. During my operational phase, I was originally only addressing two questions, but the chatbot provided information and suggested that I delve deeper into the three dimensions I had mentioned. I found this to be a useful suggestion. As I delved deeper into the concept of trust, I used different dimensions. Although they all converged to the central idea of trust, it doesn't necessarily aid in comprehending how it can help me determine the kind of questions within each dimension. It also leads the participants to think about the concept of trust, their experiences of relationships, and the factors that influence their decisions or the elements that drive their trust or mistrust.

I really tried to think of how I view trust in the world, how I act with trust, how trust operates in my life. I asked these questions for each dimension; how would I act out belief, how would I act on faith, how do I experience faith, how do I experience belief. \n\nI really just tried to circle it around myself but also included my experiences of others.

So, I attempted to propose statements of indicators such as, \"I often think positive thoughts\". This denotes an optimistic mindset. I applied similar approaches to facets like faith, belief, trust and hope as well, trying to determine how I would exhibit trust in society, for example. Would a person who trusts be vulnerable towards their close ones? I included this in my indicators as I am of the belief that a person would indeed be vulnerable towards those they trust.

How might using a chatbot for feedback influence the validity and reliability of your operational definition, specifically in the context of your survey?", "question_num": 6, "uuid": "1724df4f-a749-4c28-bb0a-091761d99f39", "created_at": 1697837701037, "response": "yeah so i think that using a chatbot for feedback influence validity and reliability of my operational definition by by adding to so like a chatbot is not a real person and i think that if i were to gauge kind of perceptions of hope and the dimensions of hope that i have labeled i think that i would have come to a similar decision however i think that it's less personable that it comes from a chatbot and that's kind of like the influence of it and as well as like because these are very personable and emotional and complex structures of how we emotionally think i think that it's hard for a chatbot to really recognize that and they really just recognize the definitions given by people or or in scenarios so i think that really does influence the validity and and reliability as well however i think that through the chatbot and through my own thinking as well we did like the best we could to get the best operational definition and it wasn't just the chatbot doing it it was definitely my brain there as well so i think that because i was able to think of like experiences that put my definition in there then the chatbot could work off that but since the chatbot doesn't have any of that it's really it's really hard for that so i think that that's exactly what would be the influence in that scenario", "improved_response": "Yeah, so I think that using a chatbot for feedback influences the validity and reliability of my operational definition. A chatbot is not a real person, and I believe that if I were to gauge perceptions of hope and the dimensions of hope that I have identified, I would have reached a similar decision. However, it feels less personable when it comes from a chatbot. This is a significant influence because these are very personal, emotional, and intricate structures of how we emotionally think. I think it's challenging for a chatbot to truly comprehend this; they mainly recognize definitions provided by people or in scenarios. This also significantly influences the validity and reliability.\n\nNonetheless, the chatbot and I, through our combined thinking, did our best to produce the most accurate operational definition. The chatbot wasn't the only one involved; my brain also made a significant contribution. Since I was able to think about experiences that formed my definition, the chatbot could then work from that. However, since the chatbot lacks any such understanding, it's a challenging process. \n\nSo, I believe that in that scenario, the huge influence comes from the chatbot not being able to fully understand and replicate human emotive and cognitive complexities."}]}, "6532f106a275536b044538d7": {"_id": "6532f106a275536b044538d7", "student_work": "Conceptual: I would like to preface that much of what I conceptualize as \"beauty\" here is due to the media I have consumed growing up in the United States and the societal norms that go along with that. I acknowledge that these effects make my perception of beauty biased and that beauty is diverse and can mean different things to different people. The media in the United States often depicts an exclusive, misogynistic type of beauty. The \"most beautiful\" women are often depicted in American media as skinny, tall, blonde, with blue eyes, sharp features, a size 2 body, simultaneously revealing/modest clothes, and are often quiet and hold their virtue. Western culture, through Hollywood, advertisements, clothing brands, magazines, and much else sell this ideal. This rigid depiction of beauty can lead to lower self esteem because most women do not fit this mold exactly, despite their efforts. Beauty can be external when it comes to physical attractiveness of humans or with pleasant aspects of our world like nature. External beauty can be displayed through scents and colors in nature or physically in humans through signs of health, symmetry, and uniqueness. Scents are in regard to odors such as fresh mountain air or flowers and colors are beautiful when they are bright and vibrant like a fall foliage or blue alpine lake. Signs of health show a person takes care of themselves and is healthy, which can manifest in fit bodies, lack of sun damage, smooth/thick hair and clear skin. Symmetry means a person's attributes are symmetrical such as distance between their eyes or cheekbone structure. Uniqueness contributes to the concept of beauty meaning that you are not like everyone else. Sure, many people find blonde white women with blue eyes beautiful, but arguably many of the most famous supermodels these days have albinism, vitiligo, and other characteristics that set them apart. Uniqueness provides a contrast to the norms and reminds people that everyone is beautiful in their own way. However, beauty can also be internal in regard to humans. Internal beauty comes from an individual's confidence, kindness, happiness, and intelligence. Confidence is manifested in how a person holds themselves, which can be demonstrated through posture, talking slowly, and actively listening. A person's kindness relates to how they interact with others - showing respect, compassion, empathy, and an all around positivity. Happiness relates to a person's outlook on the world and how their internal feelings of joy radiate to others. Finally, intelligence relates to an individual's humor, ability to interact with others, self-awareness, and navigation of social situations, and much else. Combined, these four factors have an immense impact on the feelings of those they interact with. Making someone else feel like you are secure, looking out for their best interest, happy, and interesting makes them feel good. When these characteristics are all at play, beauty radiates because you make the other person want to be in your presence. Making someone else feel heard and understood is one of the most beautiful things one human can contribute to another and these four factors are necessary to make that happen. It is important to note that though these are common western embodiments of beauty, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder because \"what is considered beautiful\" largely depends on cultural, societal, and individual factors. For example, bronzed skin is a beauty standard that many women strive to adhere to in the United States. It is common for girls to lay out in the summer and self tan/spray tan in the winter, while many women in parts of Asia take measures to avoid the sun at all costs for a paler complexion. Having tan skin in the US often symbolizes that you have been enjoying life and spending your time in the outdoors, while having darker skin in parts of Asia can symbolize lower socioeconomic status. Beauty is a complex topic that combines internal and external factors, but at the end of the day is a very inclusive term like \"art\". Individuals of all genders, backgrounds, ethnicities, ages, sexualities, etc. are all beautiful - it is not a rigid term. There is beauty in everything around us just as how anything can be described as art. \n\nOperational: To perform my study, I would send my survey out to UW students for extra credit in a certain research class (hopefully) like I did when I was in Psychology 101 freshman year. I think that the UW population is sufficient for a diverse group of participants because many students are international, there is an equal number of girls/boys, students come from diverse backgrounds socioeconomically and culturally and there are fraternities and sororities that would offer perspective based on where they live and their social circles. To uphold what we learned about researching with human subjects, I would first obtain my participants' informed consent in the survey to describe the procedure, what I am researching, my goals, etc. so that they can know what they are getting themselves into and withdraw if they feel uncomfortable or that this survey will cause any kind of harm or distress. I will assure them that whatever their responses are will be confidential and my research team and I will take measures to assure that their information is secure. The researcher would observe the operationalization by sending out this survey and seeing how students respond. For the first question, an understanding of how the individual perceives the beauty standard will provide context for the following questions on what they believe is beautiful and will also give insight into the impact of western media on their perception. The second question, using the Likert scale, will highlight how accurate or inaccurate my dimensions as the researcher are in gauging what humans find beautiful. If the majority of participants respond in disagreement to what I propose, then it will be clear that my dimensions may need some reworking. The third question asking about the person that the participant finds most beautiful will hopefully show (in how they describe the person) that it is not as much their external features, but the vibe they give off and how their positive energy impacts others to show that beauty is more internal and subjective. Asking about the greatest indicators for beauty will help me reassess the dimensions that I had posted in my original conceptualization. Lastly, in asking the participants for observations about who they find beautiful, I will try to remain unbiased in finding pictures of people I find most beautiful and I will pull from a large range of models - some more unique like Winnie Harlow and some less so like Adrianna Lima. With these different pieces of the survey, some being qualitative and some being quantitative, hopefully I will prevent some researcher misinterpretation when working with their open-ended responses.

These attributes influence the conceptualization of beauty among many humans. Regardless of the society or cultural background in which you're raised, most people, or all humans, want to continue their lineage. Aspects such as clear skin, wide hips in women, and stronger, fit men can influence this conceptualization. I try to perceive it from the perspective that, at the end of the day, we're all human, and everyone is looking to reproduce. Consequently, many people find these attributes beautiful or strive to possess them. \n\nThe presence or absence of certain signs of health contributes to beauty, which is a significant aspect of our operations. Uniqueness also affects my concept of beauty. Although many people find the same individuals appealing, we also esteem uniqueness. With the rise of supermodels and even noticeable in everyday life, people with unique features that don't mirror everyone else's, stand out, and this uniqueness is perceived as beautiful. By considering their external characteristics, it is apparent that everyone is beautiful in their unique ways, irrespective of how they portray their features.\n\nThese discussions relate to societal beauty standards because signs of health are definitively accepted as beauty standards. Their influence is more of a global phenomenon than just a societal one. Furthermore, the concept of uniqueness is related to societal standards. Predominantly in the US, inclusivity has become increasingly prevalent, notably in the modeling industry. Models like Winnie Harlow and others with albino skin or vitiligo are challenging societal beauty standards. This divergence from the norm pushes against existing perceptions. However, it is important to acknowledge this transition and its growing acceptance."}, {"conversation_id": "6532f106a275536b044538d7", "question": "Your observation that uniqueness is increasingly recognized and celebrated in our society, such as in the modeling industry, is astute.

People are starting to realize that it's not just the people with these standard features - super sharp or big eyes - that were historically considered beautiful. It's now understood that beauty isn't only confined to such features; it's more about a broad array of unique attributes, being confident and setting oneself apart. These shifts are impacting individuals' conceptualization of beauty. \n\nIf someone from the 1950s was asked who they considered beautiful, they would probably describe a certain type of person. However today, there is a wider range of beauty. This shift influences one's perception of beauty and boosts confidence. Now, it's less about comparing oneself to a rigid definition of beauty, as people can see beauty in themselves even if they don't resemble those on television. \n\nIncreasingly in TV shows and fashion events, a variety of individuals of different shapes, sizes, hair colors and skin colors are being represented. This inclusivity affords people a higher level of confidence, knowing they are represented in the media.

I took some of the terms that I used as dimensions in my conceptual definition and transformed them into measures, or variables, that could be measured when I asked people in my study to observe different faces. I asked if they found these faces beautiful or not and about certain attributes, gauging if they found them beautiful using a scale. Lastly, I asked open-ended questions about who they found the most beautiful, what attributes they found the most beautiful, and so on. \n\nI developed an operational definition and tried to include both open-ended and closed-ended questions to ensure a reliable study. Quantitative data is excellent for reliability because if an individual is asked the same questions again or if another scientist tries to replicate my study, they would be able to obtain similar results. This is because quantitative data allows for high reliability. \n\nHowever, I did not sacrifice validity in the process; I made sure to include open-ended questions as well. This allowed participants to provide their full human experience, how they felt, and what other factors might come into play that I didn't anticipate in my previous questions. This will help me as a researcher to potentially redesign my study, add or remove elements, and incorporate what the participants are saying. \n\nI believe adding open-ended questions would help me avoid misinterpreting what my participants were saying. Similarly, having quantitative data and asking questions on a Likert scale will prevent misinterpretation of responses from open-ended questions. \n\nFor operationalization, I primarily focused on university students and tried to include multiple dimensions in my study.

It includes the dimensions of imagination, originality, and ambition. Imagination means using abstractions of ideas in your mind to go beyond the conventional means of solving problems and connecting seemingly unrelated concepts. Imagination is the starting point of being creative. Originality means that a person has the ability to have an idea that has never been thought of before. Original ideas often challenge the status quo and push beyond the ideas that we have become accustomed to. Ambition is the drive to do difficult things that are required to complete a task as well as the motivation to persevere in the face of challenges and setbacks. Ambition is what brings a creative idea into reality. Imagination provides the materials for originality and ambition pushes people to use their original ideas to create innovative solutions to real-world problems. Creativity also varies across cultures and many ideas are formed in parallel to one another. When humans across cultures are faced with similar problems we come up with solutions that are similar but completely independent of each other. The inverse of this is also true something that is seen as creative in one culture may be standard practice in another.\u00a0\n\nTo operationalize creativity I would create tests that measure each of the dimensions mentioned in the conceptual definition as those elements combine in the manifestation of creativity. I would present research subjects with a series of puzzles that have a few different possible paths to a solution and researchers would then keep track of whether the path the subject took to the solution is unique or not, this would be the measure of general creativity and originality. When determining the score for this item researchers would keep track of each part of the solution that is unique to this response. Then, they would assign a score to each solution with 100 being an approach that no other respondent used. The scores would descend from there if respondents were using very similar approaches to the problems. This section would be weighted to be 40% of the total creativity score because originality is the starting point of creativity and is therefore the most important. To measure imagination, I would verbally describe an object in detail then, after the instructions finish, I would have the researcher draw what they heard to see if they can portray the abstraction of reality (words) visually. This would be scored based on how many of the details of the description were present in the drawing, 100 would contain all of the different parts and 0 would contain none. I would have multiple researchers grade each drawing and take their average score to eliminate possible biases. This section would be weighted to be 30% of the total score. 30% represents an even split between the remaining two measures after weighing originality the highest. I would use a survey to measure ambition. The survey would ask people a series of questions that evaluate how often the respondent goes beyond their comfort zone in order to complete a task or solve a problem. The survey would have the respondents rank how likely they are to go beyond their comfort zone to solve problems of different severity. The respondents would have the option to respond with these choices: \"Unlikely\", \"Somewhat unlikely\", \"Neutral\", \"Somewhat likely\", and \"Likely\". Researchers would assign numeric values to the possible responses on the survey, 1-5 from unlikely to likely. Then, the numeric values would be added together giving a total ambition score. This item will also be weighted to be 30% of the total score. For each of these tests, I would do a pilot test to work out potential issues before the study begins and to help evaluate the reliability and validity of the measures.\u00a0", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697840056936, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "651732bebc5495ba14fb91b6", "uid": "nmEK2icyjFTfR6BgxJlpxNCpq5e2", "email": "ewaara@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1696019134289, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Evan Waara", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Imagination goes hand in hand with originality. You can't really be original if you can't imagine things, and therefore you can't be creative if you can't imagine things well. Those two sort of go hand in hand. Moreover, ambition is an important part of creativity, I believe. It's not necessarily easy to do something creatively. It's much easier to just follow what you know to be an effective path to problem solving, or in the case of art, it's easy to just trace someone else's drawing for example.

This might not always be the case, I don't know for sure. I also think that programs struggle with addressing ethical questions in a compassionate, human way. If I were to ask more ethics-based questions which, to my disappointment, were lacking, I'd hesitate to trust it fully since it's a computer. However, I think the chatbot does a good job when it comes to understanding conceptual definitions. It knows how to use language to illustrate points clearly, which is beneficial. Operationally, the chatbot comprehends what studies usually look like and can compare my layout to existing ones, which I think is advantageous. One downside is that the feedback feels standardized and not truly personalized to my input. Despite this, some of its feedback has proven helpful.

Discovering how people are in person and taking time to get to know them while they're doing things they're interested in allows you to see if it applies to your own life, or if through doing it with them, it becomes something you learn to enjoy. The interests evolve as relationships or friendships progress because you're able to see that person in-depth, therefore you get to understand their interests and their priorities in life. I see this as a prerequisite for companionship, as companionship often involves spending time with someone and getting to know them more, thus understanding their interests. I believe that this develops organically from spending time together. It's impossible to force shared interests with someone; it's something that develops over time, whether that's simply getting to know someone's interests or forming those interests with the person who has something you may not initially be interested in during the early stages of your friendship."}, {"conversation_id": "6532fd5e984191e3fdd74a32", "question": "Your view that shared interests evolve from companionship is insightful, Hanna.

Validity represents accuracy, and I believe accuracy can be achieved by carefully selecting a group of individuals to participate in the survey. If this group comprises females, specifically 22-year-old college seniors who share the same socioeconomic background and culture, I believe it can yield accurate results. This method may be more reliable than selecting random groups off the street to participate in the survey. Furthermore, if a different researcher attempts to duplicate the study with a completely different group of participants, they may get different data as participants' responses can vary greatly. Hence, it would be difficult to maintain accuracy with each iteration of the survey. \n\nAlso, I believe that reliability can be carried out in this survey with the chosen group. Since the survey would be repeated multiple times with the same group, the results would align with the basic standards that I previously outlined for this specific group. This is crucial, especially when measuring the apparentness of each dimension with a scale from one to ten in a friendship context. \n\nIn addition, I believe that interim validity would be observed here as well, because the survey involves the same questions being answered using the same scale by the same group of people.

The spectrum is not merely limited to one or two, where a choice needs to be made. It's simultaneously not apparent and very apparent, acknowledging the vast array of variables that sit between. Consequently, implementing a one to ten scale permits a more profound exploration and clarity of individual beliefs on that specific dimension. Rather than forcing a choice between one side or another, this approach provides more data to work with. Having specific percentages that correspond, indicating how many people may find it apparent, versus those who might not, augments this method.

Romantically, love involves attraction and the idealization of that partner, whereas platonically, love is a deeply bonded relationship that excludes any sexual attraction. It is worth noting other abstract facets of love, such as self-love, familial love, and spiritual love.\" \n\nOperationalization: The multifaceted concept of love can be best operationalized through a self-report Likert-scale study. In a self-report, subjects may show feelings of specific types of love depending on their responses to questions that may reveal intense attraction, adoration, and various ways of expressing affection. For example, responses suggesting feelings of sexual desire or idealization may indicate romantic love, whereas responses showing no physical attraction but an intense bond may point toward platonic love. In setting key indicators for each type of love, responses may be more generalizable. This can be best utilized through the use of questions that are specific to each dimension. If the sum of the answers ranks higher on the Likert scale, then we can theorize that the level/type of love is most likely the one implied in those questions. The risk of a self-report study is the Hawthorne Effect, which is the change in behavior that occurs in respondents to be more socially desirable when they are aware they are being observed. Another risk is the possibility of weak validity or weak reliability, which may cause the study to unintentionally evaluate another concept or provide skewed data that could have been prevented through pilot testing. To mitigate these risks, the study can be completely anonymous through either a virtual setting or a preventative measure in which one researcher knows the names but not the faces, and one knows the faces but not the names, to maximize the benefits of an in-person study.

Have others called them generous and what was the context of that moment, provide a spot to write out the answer.\u00a0 What do they consider right and wrong? How would they process questions that often put people in the gray area? What main concerns do they focus on when questioning various situations? Do people often call them out for behavior? Do others turn to them when asking for practical help? How do they consider the further implications of their actions? For open-ended question, we will briefly skim each answer that has been provided to find key words that appear in multiple responses. Then we will focus on the questions in which we found those key words to further decide to add another category or if the response fits into an existing category. Due to the nature of open-ended responses, we will add categories as needed and elaborate on this process in the typed out results once the experiment has been concluded.\u00a0 All participants are given an estimated length for how long it will take to complete said survey, in which the goal length will be 10 to 15 minutes. They are also given the choice to decline to take the test. For those who do deicide to answer the survey if they want to put their name on the test they can do so, a place for their name will be provided, but there will be a clear bolded line that informs them that adding their name is optional. There will also be a means of contact if they would like to follow-up with the researcher over any questions, comments, concerns.\u00a0", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697849374263, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "65136413f1bc67107c90bdcc", "uid": "8Ir51YuQa2cce0byPZsSMj7uC2A3", "email": "ydrozd@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1695769619659, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "YESPHIR Y DROZDYUK", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

These five senses can be either stimulated simultaneously or individually. Varying perceptions can often be influenced by one's connection to cultural/historical contexts and/or the emotions one feels towards the subject. Beauty often encompasses dimensions such as harmony and pleasure. In regards to beauty, harmony means the combination of details put together creating something pleasurable to see/hear/taste/touch/smell. Pleasure is defined as satisfaction and delight. \u00a0\n\nFor this study, I want to specifically focus on observing how subjective beauty truly is based on the more visual aspect of the concept (as opposed to smell, taste, sound, and touch).\n\nI will have pictures and ask people to rate different faces or pictures of people on a scale of 1-7, 7 being the most attractive. I would also have them rate these people's individual features (eye shape, nose shape, lips shape) on a scale of 1-7.\u00a0\n\nI would then ask them to rate the same face with different/edited combinations of features (ex. eye distance, nose length, etc.) from a scale of 1-7 to measure facial harmony's role in perceiving beauty. These changes in features will be isolated from others meaning there will only be one feature changed at a time.\u00a0\n\nTo measure pleasure, I would most likely ask the people to rate how they feel when seeing the pictures/faces on a scale of 1-7.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRanking is numbered as followed:\u00a0\nNot attractive (1), very below avg.

This random sample would be collected from a diverse population to account for things like different cultures' beauty standards. The sample of people will be debriefed/informed on what they will need to do, the subjects in the pictures will also be informed; both parties must consent to the study.

Some people argue it's not because it doesn't look beautiful, but others think it is because it invokes feelings within them.

This method captures some nuance, but obviously, quantifying emotions isn't necessarily a nuanced process in general.

As for ensuring the reliability of the measure, I must admit that I didn't include any reliability tests in my study for measuring emotions.

That's why I opted for a more ordinal level of measurement. I wanted to keep that consistent across beauty, harmony, and pleasure as I thought it would be easier that way.

If it were more like an interview style or a qualitative style, I wouldn't really know how to operationalize, let alone interpret it. \n\nAlso, I believe with qualitative studies people tend to express what they think is logical. People tend to not just say what they think, but consider what they want to say, if that makes sense. For instance, I wanted them to rank because they're given options and have to choose one. That's when people are more decisive and assert what they want to say because that's what they're thinking. However, if it were qualitative, like asking \"Do you think this person is beautiful?\", they'd probably say yes every time because they don't want to hurt somebody's feelings or risk being misinterpreted, which is another reason I chose a more quantitative style of study.\n\nAs for validity and reliability, for validity, I think I just tried to stick to the dimensions and also remained close to the concept. In my concept definition, I discussed cultural differences and how perceptions might be influenced based on culture. For the operationalization, I wanted to include that in my random sample drawn from a diverse population, potentially with different beauty standards.\n\nRegarding reliability, I wanted to design the study so that one could simply change the variables and the wording so that it could be applied to different aspects of beauty like hearing, sound, touch, taste - things that were also outlined and related in the concept I wrote.

This was not explicitly stated in my write-up; however, given total freedom, I would have a larger sample group from different states or even from different countries. \n\nFurthermore, I would not want a single individual to represent their entire culture, since people within the same culture can have different perceptions of beauty standards. This, in itself, is a challenge because the results could greatly vary and be highly dependent on these differing perceptions. \n\nTake someone from Southeast Asia who has lived here from a young age, for instance. While they are from a diverse culture, their understanding of beauty standards is influenced by this culture, which may not necessarily reflect the standards of their home country.

Its AI nature enables it to take into account social circumstances as they are today, which influences its responses. It's as if you're conversing with a combination of multiple perspectives all melded into one. This merging of perspectives enriches the validity because it amalgamates multiple truths into one conglomerate. \n\nWhen you incorporate more perspectives and truths, it validates a study more effectively. As for reliability, the chatbot can detect inconsistencies just like a code interpreter. Therefore, an inconsistent study isn't reliable. Thus, the chatbot may aid in enhancing the reliability of a study by detecting these inconsistencies, pointing them out, and allowing them to be corrected.

You might have a lower bit of stress that's more manageable. However, you can also experience stress that's so high, it leads to a panic attack.

However, it's worth noting that it gets its information from online sources and human input. This is not quite the same as discussing the concept with multiple people who have different experiences. For instance, when dealing with stress, people have had different experiences. Therefore, it might be better to engage in a detailed conversation with those individuals to genuinely capture the entire concept."}]}, "6533404fa275536b0445397e": {"_id": "6533404fa275536b0445397e", "student_work": "Diversity is the range of representation of variation within an entire group that makes up the whole. This could be an inclusion of properties that differ in background, socio-economic status, ethnicity, cultural elements, experience, sexual orientation, and projected image. Generally, diversity is important in maximizing the representation of perspectives that vary so more insight or productivity is gained amongst the whole. It can also be varied in subjects that carry different properties for variances in observations such as within scientific methods. Background is the precedented factors or events that molded the subject or individual to form and shape themselves into present day. Socio-economic status are indicators that represent you within a society and measures your knowledge and resources to indicate your status amongst others in that society. Ethnicity is your identity to your cultural origin from descendants and is often correlated to physical features such as pigmentation as well as geographical location. Cultural elements are factors that make up ones overall culture such as language, customs, practices, heritage, traditions, and religion which also influences the base of ethnicity. Experience is undergoing timely events that has effect on the subjects overall understanding, wisdom, or conscious in internalizing surrounding environments and moments. Sexual orientation is the identity of sexual attraction and perceived gender. Projected image is the subjects outward expression with use of symbols that take the shape of apparel, communication, and habits and gives ideas about the subject to others.\nI will conduct a questionnaire that will be in three parts. The first part will be asking which ethnicity/nationality you identify as with an open text box to write their answers in. Afterward, all answers of ethnicity will be assigned the number of participants that identified as that ethnicity (example: 15 identified as Mexican American, 10 identified as Black American, etc\u2026). For the second part there will be percentage options in increments of 10 (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%) and participants will be asked, \u201cbased on your observation and experience, choose the percentage that best fits the representation of diversity in your area, at or below 10%, at or below 20%, at or below 30%, at or below 40%, at or below 50%, at or below 60%, at or below 70%, at or below 80%, at or below 90%, at or below 100% \u201d. In the final part I will provide another open text box for them to explain why they chose that percentage as well as if they think there are any indicators why it is that way. Each answer will be observed for common answers/themes in correlation to the ethnicity/nationality of the participants that answered.\nThe study would be conducted amongst High School Students that would be pulled from an absolute random sample size. A total of 100 students randomly selected would then be anonymously asked to answer the three part questionnaire and state what grade of schooling they\u2019re in. Institutions, such as schools, reflect the demographics of an area appropriately and teenagers tend to give rather honest personal perspectives especially in relation to their environment. This will capture not only how they view their surroundings, but also how they choose to identify themselves amongst said surrounding. Due to minors being involved in the study no name, age, or any other personal information will be asked further ensuring anonymity. They will be asked to participate solely on the three parts of the questionnaire.", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697857615480, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "65177f1df1bc67107c90c180", "uid": "rQJ35IfyzVaWORBiPFzg14qYpIN2", "email": "silver22@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1696038685594, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Damien J Silver", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Deviance can be multidimensional, and encompass several aspects of life. For example, religious deviance - moving away from the religion of your family or community towards a relatively unknown or even \u2018unaccepted\u2019 religion. An indicator of this type of deviance might be a person getting rid of their christian bible and purchasing books on paganism. Another dimension of deviance might be professional, in that someone could move away from a predetermined career choice in favor of another. For example, if a person\u2019s parents were both doctors and it was expected of the person to go to medical school to also become a doctor, but they decided to pursue a technical certificate in welding. In this case, this person would deviate from the professional norm set by their family. An indicator of this type of deviance would be what school the person was enrolled in - a technical college or trade school as opposed to the medical school of a university.\nIt is also important to consider the broader societal dimension of deviance as well. In most scenarios, it is highly encouraged for people to follow molds and align themselves with societal norms. These expectations are manifested in different ways, such as young people are expected to go to college after high school, or even when people are expected to stay in the same small town they grew up in to raise families and uphold traditions. When someone acts outside of those norms, they are often ostracized or looked down on by society. For example, in the case of the person who became a welder instead of a doctor like their parents. It is possible to assume that their parents, who might have worked very hard to give their child a life of opportunity, or who might have expended energy in ensuring their child was ready to attend medical school, might be largely disappointed by their child's decision to become a welder. Moreover,  U.S. society today puts a higher value on those in positions of power, such as doctors, compared to tradesmen, like welders. This person might not receive the same amount of acknowledgement or respect purely based on his career of choice. \n\nOperationalization: In this example, we can operationalize religious deviance. Given the inherent sensitivity associated with inquiring about people\u2019s religious preferences, it is important for the researcher to be as ethical and as sensitive as possible. As such, prior to beginning the study, it would be appropriate for the researcher to seek approval of an IRB to confirm that the risk of harm to the study members is minimal. Moreover, to determine if their questions are accurate to the goals of the study and culturally aware, the researcher might review their questions with different religious groups. From there, the researcher might gather a random sampling of people across various regions of the United States. Given a random sampling of people, whose names and personal information will only be known to the researcher, they can look at the amount of the population who identify as christian or who have christian paraphernalia compared to the amount of the population who have no religious affiliation/paraphernalia or who identify as affiliated with a \u2018new\u2019 religion/spirituality. Of the population who have no religious affiliation, called Group A, they can be surveyed to further narrow down if they did not grow up in a religious household, contributing to their non-religious affiliation, or if they did grow up in a religious household but eventually deviated from that \u2018norm\u2019. The survey will contain specific questions related to the study, such as Do you consider yourself affiliated with christianity? Yes or No? and, at a later point in the study, such questions as Did you grow up in a religious household? Yes or No? The researcher can then review the numerical results of the study, which will help them to better determine if religious deviance is likely to occur generationally or of the individual\u2019s own accord.

Living as a person who deviates from these norms can be very difficult in that type of environment or society. \n\nThus, societal norms can cause a person to hide or oppress who they truly are, in fear for their own safety. These societal norms have massive implications, often detrimental to individuals. When someone deviates from these norms and is considered \"deviant\", it can invite criticism and misunderstanding, but it also highlights crucial issues.\n\nThis deviance does not necessarily cause other people to react negatively, because it contributes to the multi-dimensional aspects of deviance. It exposes societal structures that contribute to inequities. It shows that it is not the norm to be heterosexual, white, cisgendered; there are other ways to live and not all human beings fall under those categories. \n\nBy transitioning away from these norms, people have the opportunity to examine societal structures more closely, even our patriarchal society as a whole. I believe this could spur some very productive conversations."}, {"conversation_id": "653342d4a275536b0445398b", "question": "Your insights about societal influences on deviance, Nel, are truly profound.

This method allows individuals to express their honest opinions accurately rather than merely conforming to experimental expectations. Hope as a subject is challenging to study without a reliable, statistical approach. The Likert scale spans a meaningful range and provides a common ground, thus making it easier to interpret the results of the study. Its use potentially increases the study's accuracy.\n\nEspecially when anonymous, as is often the case, the Likert scale requires minimal cognitive exertion.

My interpretation of respect is a tolerance for other people's ideas, personalities, and characteristics. I believe respect means listening to other people's ideas; you may not necessarily agree or understand their thought process or actions, but it's crucial to exhibit respect and withhold judgments. \n\nThe second dimension is support. This includes providing assistance by encouraging people, either emotionally or through actions. In the context of a loving relationship, the provision of support, be it in actions or emotions, is significant.  For people in a relationship, receiving support from their partner is essential. \n\nNext is care, which involves looking after an individual's living circumstances and mental health to ensure their well-being. In my opinion, caring for others is a significant aspect of love. When love exists, people unconsciously express their concern for others.\n\nFinally, in relation to the complexity, I believe love is indeed complicated.

Lily Novak 2) \n\nHope is a state of mind where one is optimistic about an outcome of a particular situation. Furthermore, hope can be considered a wish; for better and for a fulfilling, positive experience. \nDimensions included: optimistic, wish, better, fulfilling, positive.\nFirstly, optimistic or optimism can be defined as a state of mind where one feels positive and confident about a situation. An example of this can be, \u201cI feel optimistic that my sister will place in the top 5 of her cross country race\u201d. \nWish is the second dimension in my definition. A wish can be defined as having a strong desire for something or someone. Desire and wish tie hand in hand, it\u2019s when one has a strong passion or drive towards something. It\u2019s a want. \nThe third dimension, better, is the idea of having a more positive alternative to the state someone or something actually is. \nThe fourth dimension; fulfilling or fulfillment, is a state where one feels satisfied and at peace. Satisfaction or being satisfied is very closely related to fulfillment. It\u2019s a state where one doesn\u2019t feel the need to act on. The outcome is good enough. The same goes for the dimension of peace. An example of this is painting and finally being done with finishing touches, \u201cI feel satisfied with my painting. I am not going to add anything more\u201d.\nPositive/positivity is the fifth dimension and it\u2019s a state where one has feel-good emotions. \nFinally, the last dimension is passion/drive. This is the concept that someone has adamant/strong feelings in accomplishing a goal or certain outcome.\n\n\nTo measure the amount of hope the average person has in today\u2019s society, we will conduct a survey where people will be asked about their opinions regarding current events in the world. We will conduct a survey study of 200 participants. Firstly, the participants will consent to the study through informed consent. If a kid is participating, we will get consent from them and their legal guardians. These 200 participants will be extremely diverse, ranging from the ages of 12-85. We will focus on getting diverse ethnicities, backgrounds, sexualities, etc. On the survey, people will be measured on positivity, problem-solving capabilities, and passion levels. The survey will be in the format of the likert scale. Asking on a scale of 1-5, how hopeful does one feel about a certain circumstance. After participants responded, we will ask them a few weeks later the same or very similar questions to get the most valid answers. This is the test-retest method. This would promote reliability and validity. We will also ensure that participants will remain anonymous for creating the most honest responses. After both tests have been conducted, we will compare and gain the average level of hope regarding certain subjects. Certain questions will also reveal information regarding other traits; like passion. An example of this on the survey would be: \u201cOn a scale of 1-5, 1 being not hopeful at all, and 5 being most hopeful, How would you rate your hope of our government ending homelessness\u201d. In the next question it would ask, \u201cOn a scale of 1-5, 1 being not hopeful at all, and 5 being most hopeful, If it were up to you, how would you rate your hope of ending homelessness? (If you had the power to make changes on your own terms)\u201d. We would gather the means of the likert scale responses and then try to determine focal points through the means and most common answers. \nDimensions included: Hope/positivity, problem-solving capabilities, passion\nThe first dimension; hope/positivity, can be defined as a state of mind where one is positive about an outcome of a particular situation. Positivity can further be defined as a state where one has feel-good emotions towards a certain subject. \nThe second dimension is problem solving capabilities/skills. This can be defined as determining how one can react and go about certain situations. Can exemplify creativity and open mindedness. Creativity in the concept of problem solving is formulating an idea that takes a lot of brain power and clear thought. An example where one would portray their problem solving skills is if a person was lost in the woods. What would their first step be to find their way back to their campsite? One with strong problem solving skills would make a fire signal.\nPassion is the third dimension and it\u2019s the concept that someone has adamant/strong feelings in accomplishing a goal or certain outcome.\n", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697862834893, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "6533542ba275536b044539b4", "uid": "TC9nDZi8YAVM2riUlHi9WxcXcfu1", "email": "lilyfrancesnovak@gmail.com", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1697862699482, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Lily Novak 2", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Something is true when it is currently real (aka in existence), is promised to be real (and later is real), and when it was real in the past.\n\nFor distrust to occur, there is also the existence of paranoia in a person or system, or the feeling that something bad will happen if another person or system is believed in their words or actions. A bad action causes emotions like pain or fear, and statuses like failure or death.\n\nDistrust also requires that the person or system have an ego, or the belief that they are better than the other person or system. To be better is to have more success in something, whether that be abstract (a concept) or physical (a material thing on this world).\n\nIn a survey, ask participants to rate their agreement on a scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree with seven options for statements (strongly disagree, adequately disagree, somewhat disagree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat agree, adequately agree, strongly agree).

It could be that their actions in the past have led you to no longer trust what they say. It could be that you think you're better than everyone around you, and that's why you can't trust them to complete the assignment in a group project. It could be paranoia, just this overwhelming fear of people or things around you. I think there's a connotation with paranoia that maybe the fear is unfounded.

Mistrust or distrust is all about this idea of the lack of belief. There's just no way that you can think of the thing or the action or the words that are being said as being actually true.

As I said before, paranoia often involves unfounded fear. Therefore, it is usually thought of as a deep internal conflict. It's a notion that exists within your mind. But when examining the lack of belief, it can be perceived as more external. I used the example previously of someone who hasn't been truthful or done something contrary to their promises. I believe that this is clearly an external factor. Or perhaps you possess some sort of proof that grounds your beliefs. Paranoia is often associated with an unfounded fear. I ignored this fact when preparing the quiz answers for the assignment. However, upon examining the interplay between various factors, the same can be said about ego. Ego is usually deemed very internalized. It carries a negative connotation, pointing at those with overly inflated egos. But I think your ego can also be elevated by the awards you've won or your professional status. For me, it's worth exploring how these can be divided into internal and external factors. It's essential to distinguish between something intrinsic, something intuitive, and something backed by evidence when it comes to distrust."}, {"conversation_id": "653356f2a275536b044539b9", "question": "It's insightful how you're considering the interplay between internal and external factors in distrust, Jada.

The general idea is to just get people saying \"yes, I trust this,\" \"no, I don't,\" in a very \"yes\" or \"no\" kind of response. \n\nI ended up choosing the Likert scale to measure a little bit more closely how trusting people are. I also went with a seven point scale for that Likert scale. We'll see it give a little bit more variety in answers, but I think it's definitely interesting to look at how you want to measure this, like the level of measurement you want to go into. \n\nThe Likert scale is very low on our levels of measurement. For instance, it's a yes or no level, unlike a ratio level. The ratio level can be more beneficial as it offers a higher level of measurement. However, I chose the lower level of measurement to try to balance validity and reliability a little bit more evenly in my study. \n\nAs I said before, I have a large list of relationships to get through.

Through the long list of relationships, I was trying to increase the validity of the study. But at the same time, I was really focusing on the reliability of the study and choosing the Likert scale to assign numerical values to answers. \n\nOf course, in having enough answers, you could have for instance both positive statements and negative statements about trust for each relationship and dimension, which would then hopefully be a sign of the test-retest method working if some of those answers are starting to have similar numerical values once you adjust for negative versus positive responses or statements.

The concept of trauma has multiple dimensions. One being physical trauma which would be if you are dealing with a lingering physical injury of some kind. Another dimension of trauma is mental and emotional trauma which are different yet closely tied to each other in many cases. Mental trauma is when a person or thing endures an intense event in life and that event was so damaging and hurtful to that persons mental health that going forward it reshaped their philosophy on aspects of life and in some cases causes people to distance themselves from others. In some scenarios mental trauma can lead to disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder which in turn can trigger a persons brain and force them to have sporadic reactions out of their control. Sometimes when victims of trauma are feeling such intense feelings of anxiety or anger they might cope with the stress of it all by doing dramatic things such as shouting, drugs, or even getting physically abusive because they may not have to tool to handle it all. But on a much brighter note people can recover from mental trauma through therapy and seeing other professional health specialists. Emotional trauma can be caused by negative childhood experiences such as the death of a friend or family member. Emotional trauma is when a person or thing endures an intense event in life and that event was so damaging and hurtful to that person that when said person remembers that event or even when a separate event feels familiar to the original event they react with serious feelings of anger, anxiety, dissociation, flashbacks, shutting down completely and in some cases severe depression. But much like mental trauma there are ways to recover from emotional trauma by utilizing health professionals such as therapists and doctors.\n\nOperational Definition\n\nPhysical trauma:\n\nIn a survey, I will gather a high schools senior class and have them all answer If they are currently experiencing physical trauma and if they are they will answer how much discomfort they are feeling from it on a scale from 0-10. Next they will answer if their gender is either male or female. And I will make it clear that they do not have to identify themselves with their name or date of birth. Finally, the student will receive a free pamphlet detailing how to deal with trauma and where they can find help for free.\n\nMental trauma:\n\nIn a survey, I will gather a high schools senior class and have them all answer If they are currently experiencing mental trauma and if they are they will answer how much discomfort they are feeling from it on a scale from 0-10.

Next they will answer if their gender is either male or female. And I will make it clear that they do not have to identify themselves with their name or date of birth. Finally, the student will receive a free pamphlet detailing how to deal with trauma and where they can find help for free.\n\nMy Scale explained:\n\n0: No trauma whatsoever\n\n1: I hardly even notice it if I even do\n\n2: It bothers me here and there\n\n3: I'm beginning to recognize my trauma better\n\n4: My trauma makes doing tasks slightly more difficult\n\n5: 1 or more of my relationships have been effected by my trauma\n\n6: I fully recognize my trauma and I'm afraid of it becoming something larger and more problematic\n\n7: Doing something as minor as self-care is becoming increasingly more difficult\n\n8: I need help managing my anxiety asap\n\n9: I'm barely getting through my school day\n\n10: I'm experiencing the most excruciating mental trauma imaginable\n\nOnce my group has collected all of the results we will find the average percentage for each number on the scale for all three dimensions. By doing this we will determine what percentage of students are experiencing a 0 (no trauma whatsoever)-10 (I'm experiencing the most excruciating mental trauma imaginable) on physical trauma, mental trauma, and emotional trauma. And we will also measure how many females compared to male scaled above and below a 5. This is important because by having an understanding of the students health we can better gauge their suffering and work to mediate and minimize it alongside school registration.

Creativity is a character trait that can be experienced to different degrees, while also being a dynamic process people go through with various stages of ideation, refinement, and implementation. Creativity is affected by one's positionality, which refers to one's gender, race, class, ethnicity, ability, geographical location, education, and social norms. Creativity is most commonly associated with art, but can be applied to all aspects of life involving innovation. Original thought can be understood as the capacity to come up with unique ideas and solutions, which unique can be understood as one of a kind or different from others. Self-expression can be understood as putting one-selfs passion and essence into something, with passion being understood as strong feelings and essence being understood as a quality or aspect of self. Innovation can be understood as developing new ideas and creating value. Imagination can be understood as the ability to envision a mental image of something not currently present. With creativity, one has the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas. Dimensions: Original thought, self-expression, innovation, and imagination\n\nindicators for each dimension:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nimagination: someone who prefers their own mind to the real world; someone who gets lost in thought, someone who approaches issues with an open mind and wants to experiment, someone who can add detail, depth, and complexity\u00a0\n\ninnovation: someone who is able to come up with multiple solutions for one issue, someone who has a strong urge to explore and learn new things, someone who can come up with many ideas in a short period of time\n\nself-expression: someone who is in touch with themselves emotionally, someone who has a strong sense of self, someone who puts authenticity into their passion\n\nOriginal thought: Someone who comes up with unconventional ideas, someone who thinks of seemingly unrelated concepts\n\nI would create a self-reporting survey with questions relating to all the indicators listed above and ask how much the participant feels it relates to them on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being strongly disagree, 3 being neutral, and 5 being strongly agree. Once the participant is done with the survey, you tally up all your points and the higher the number, the more creative the participant is. In order to ensure more reliable and valid results I would ask each indicator in different ways to check if their answers match each other and to add clarity.

I tried to think about it very holistically and generally, instead of trying to focus too much on art or anything specific like that.\n\nWhen it comes to the idea of original thought creativity, creativity at its base is this underlying idea of being different, of being original. That's how I thought about self-expression. Self-expression came about because I feel like that's one area where I find a lot of creativity. We are all unique individuals, and being able to express that often comes through within creativity. It's the practice of infusing our work with our personal touch and that's another premise of creativity.\n\nInnovation was another dimension I considered, as I was trying to broaden how creativity could be applied. With original thought and self-expression, it was still kind of playing into more artistic aspects whereas innovation is the idea of coming up with new ideas. A part of being creative is having the ability to think outside of the box, to envision new ways of doing things, different methods, and so forth.\n\nThen there's imagination, which is the concept of being able to process a variety of thoughts and come up with numerous different things.\n\nThus, my process was really just sitting down and deliberating on the different aspects and various perspectives creativity can take on."}, {"conversation_id": "65336e80a275536b044539e9", "question": "Your perspective on creativity as a holistic concept that transcends traditional artistic realms is enlightening, Jenny.

So, how does original thought and self-expression kind of apply to that? Well, I kept the creative process of being ideation, refinement, and implementation - I think is what I said - being very broad because creativity is so broad. Original thought, because it's original, you can't really predict it; you can't really put it within a certain exact process. So, with that, it kind of falls into ideation, I would say.

For example, I've attempted to keep the identifiers general while also asking questions that are specific enough for people to provide reliable and valid responses. \n\nIn order to ensure more reliable and valid results, I suggested asking each indicator in different ways to verify if their responses are consistent, and thus, clarify any confusion. I would also introduce control questions to detect inconsistencies in participants' answers, mitigating the potential for response bias. This means having multiple questions asking for similar things to ensure consistency. \n\nSorry, give me a second; I need to double-check something.

I incorporated a pretest. This was done to double check that my wording resonates well because the individuals I would do a pretest with would also come from a relatively diverse pool. They can provide feedback on things that may or may not have resonated well with them. In addition to this, I also tried to make my questions broad. I avoided making anything overly specific.

For me, I took a lot of advice from it, though sometimes the feedback it provided seemed redundant because I felt I had already covered that point. However, it helped me change the wording a bit on some of the things I said, for clarity. I definitely believe it positively influenced my process, because it gave me feedback on certain course material that I had forgotten about. It helped me remember the importance of informed consent within the process, which is crucial to ensuring participants' safety and comfort. One thing I noticed was that it wanted to keep my definition of creativity very general. When I was trying to develop my indicators, it didn't give me advice that led me into a very specific subsection of creativity. I don't really know exactly how to articulate what I'm trying to say. My point is that sometimes, the AI or chatbot tool didn't fully grasp what I was trying to communicate and therefore overcorrected me. It gave me feedback that was ultimately helpful, but it might have detracted from my personal goal for this project. In conclusion, while the chatbot was really effective, in the end, it's still a bot.

This complex emotional state can vary in intensity and scope, shaping an individual's or group's perception of themselves and their emotional experience. Self-esteem refers to a person's sense of self-worth and confidence in their abilities. It represents an intrinsic foundation upon which one can build a sense of pride. For example, people with a high-level of self-esteem may feel a deep and lasting sense of pride in themselves regardless of external validation. Accomplishment results from successfully achieving goals or overcoming obstacles, leading to a sense of personal or group sense of achievement. The pride experienced through accomplishment can be enduring and satisfying, as it is often grounded in one's intrinsic sense of competence. Recognition involves external validation and acknowledgement from others for one's accomplishments. It creates a sense of being valued by others. It can take the form of praise, awards, or even just the admiration of others, and can enhance the overall experience of pride. Pride as a whole is highly individualized and based on emotions that can be influenced by various factors, including cultural and individual variations. In some cultures it may be closely tied to humility while in others it may emphasize personal achievement.

Being worried means feeling afraid that there is going to be negative outcome or certain task or situation. One example of feeling overwhelmed and worried would be going through a divorce.\u00a0 Psychological reaction can make you feel anxiety and other wide range of emotions or thoughts such as anger, sadness and even depression. Anger is an emotional state that gets you upset and feel unpleased with rage. Sadness is also an emotional state of feeling unhappy and sorrow. Depression is an illness that makes you feel negatively and leads you to think and act in negative ways to yourself such as suicide.\u00a0 Physical symptoms may appear\u00a0 when experiencing anxiety, such as, sweating, shaking, fast heart rate or feeling nausea. Physical reaction would be suddenly experiencing\u00a0 migraines , any type of body aches, or any type of physical reaction that causes pain while feeling overwhelmed or going through highly stressful situations.

For example, to measure indifference, we could ask, \"What was your general interest in what you just learned about?\" and provide them with a Likert scale. Data could then be recovered from that. That being said, if someone indicates that they don't care at all, that gives us a sign that they may be apathetic as they're quite indifferent about it. The same methodology applies for impassiveness, but as the surveys are about self-perception, the question would be formulated more like, \"What is your recent emotional state on this scale?\" One side signifies feeling many emotions or feeling great, whereas the other side indicates a lack of emotions. If someone answers on the 'devoid of emotions' side, they might be apathetic. Lastly, to gauge lack of motivation, we would once again use self-perception of motivation.

Cognitively understanding is being able to grasp what the emotion is, emotionally feeling is being able to internally compartmentalize the emotion and compassionately console is being able to offer relief through understanding rather than through pity. Having all 3 of these dimensions is important to distinguishing Empathy from Sympathy which is just pity for an emotion as well as Emotional Contagion which is just copying someones emotional expression. Empathy has different levels varying from low to high and is a skill that can be consciously developed with practice.\n\n\nI would use interviews for the Operationalization of Empathy. These interviews would consist of an Interviewer, Participant, and Researcher observing. The interviewer will give the participant a real-life scenario and then ask questions to see if the indicators of the 3 skills are being shown. The 3 skills being measured are Understanding, Feeling, and Compassion. The indicator for the behavior Understanding would be the ability to summarize a real-life scenario and include key aspects of it in your reiteration. The indicators for feeling include increased heart rate/faster breathing, shaking or sweating, turning pale, feeling queasy. I would use an interview scenario in which the participant is exposed to scenarios by the interviewer and asked to respond about their feelings towards that. In order to measure understanding, the participant can be asked to redefine the scenario and the interviewer can measure their understanding on a 5 point scale, 0 being no understanding and 5 being high understanding. To measure feeling, we can have an outside researcher watching the reactions of the participant to see if their emotions, physical characteristics change. The researcher and interviewer can both rate this on a 5 point scale. Lastly, to measure compassion the interviewer can ask the participant to imagine that if the interviewer were the person that experienced the scenario, how would they console this person, what would they say/do. The researcher and interviewer can rate their compassion on a 5 point scale. Then the ratings can be added up to have a measure of empathy. With 0 being No empathy and each point adding up corresponding to a higher level of empathy. A person with a score of 11-15 has high empathy for example, but a person with 10 and a person with 11 still have similar levels of empathy. Also, for the Operationalization of this concept, I would have a pre-test debrief which talks about the fact that the scenarios are not real, and that they do not correspond to real events, however during the experiment they should be treated as real. Also, there will be a post-test debrief that includes support for participants and gives them a space to destress from the test. \n", "is_complete": true, "with_video": true, "created_at": 1697909374359, "completed_time": null, "student": {"_id": "65175ed5f1bc67107c90c155", "uid": "5f1GI2DHyRaU3gtl66kPugX6lhZ2", "email": "hrich2@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1696030421607, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Harrison Lyndon Rich", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Were there any challenges you faced while devising this approach?", "question_num": 1, "uuid": "4a3c8d2e-5b1d-4641-8875-61a06df4e21c", "created_at": 1697909494091, "response": "i think one of the key factors in this assignment and coming up with the methodology for this one was first choosing the topic when i chose empathy i think it's something that i both know about and don't know about so it's something i had to look into a little bit about and think about a lot and i think that coming up with a conceptual definition was kinda hard and the use of a chatbot like chat g b t to kinda go through my definition and help me it did help a lot because at first i had the two dimensions but i forgot compassion and that was an important one and then coming up with the methodology for the operationalization and actually testing this empathy or measuring empathy quantitatively i think it's hard to measure something like a feeling or like a skill that it is quantitatively because you have what someone could say about themselves or you have what others can observe and i think it was important have what others observe because if you're self reporting your your you know empathic behaviors or things that might be indicators of empathy then you might you know choose a little higher than you know you actually are so i thought that the methodology of having in a one on one interview while there also is a researcher observing this and observing the different factors was a good way to go", "improved_response": "I think one of the key factors in this assignment, and in devising the methodology for it, was first choosing the topic. When I chose empathy, I recognized it as a subject that I both know about and don't know about, so it was something I had to research and contemplate. I believe that developing a conceptual definition was somewhat difficult. \n\nThe use of a chatbot, like ChatGPT, was beneficial in refining my definition. It significantly assisted me, because at first, I only recognized two dimensions of empathy but then I realized that I overlooked compassion, which is an essential aspect. \n\nConstructing the methodology for the operationalization and actually quantifying empathy was challenging. Measuring something intangible, like a feeling or skill, quantitatively is problematic as you have to consider someone's self-perception or what others can observe. \n\nIt was vital to include others' observations, because if you're self-reporting empathetic behaviours or aspects that might be indicators of empathy, you might be bias and exaggerate your own ability. Therefore, I believe that having a one-on-one interview, while a researcher observes and notes different factors, was an effective method."}, {"conversation_id": "65340a7ea275536b04453a29", "question": "I see, Harrison, choosing the topic and forming your definition were key early steps. Now, can you explain how you developed the three dimensions - understanding, feeling, and compassion - for your concept of empathy?

Emotional contagion is the idea that you're merely mimicking someone else's expressions but not actually understanding them, and not genuinely feeling what they feel. \n\nI believed it was essential to consider the cognitive aspect - the understanding of the problem or the situation that someone else is going through. This, in my view, is the first step. \n\nSecondly, you should possess the ability to feel what the other person is feeling, whether it's negativity or positivity. Lastly, you should be able to console the person or have compassion for their situation, because without this, sympathy is simply pity. You might be understanding and might be able to feel a little, but the capability to express compassion and demonstrate understanding, even when something hasn't happened to you, is an important dimension to consider."}, {"conversation_id": "65340a7ea275536b04453a29", "question": "It's clear you've carefully distinguished empathy from sympathy and emotional contagion, Harrison. You've identified understanding, feeling, and compassion as essential dimensions of empathy. Given your definition, how do you ensure these dimensions are accurately and fairly measured during the interviews? How do you account for the subjectivity that might arise in such a process?", "question_num": 3, "uuid": "1e1acac1-874c-474f-ad39-4048ffbb3c62", "created_at": 1697909723013, "response": "i think that to ensure that these dimensions are accurately and fairly measured we have to have different indicators or different questions different parts of the interview that cater to each part right so like we're gonna have a part where we're explaining the interviewer is explaining the situation and then the participant is asked to reiterate or re kind of summarize what that situation is and if they're able to hit the key points that include emotional aspects that include understanding what the scope of the situation is the context if they're able to reiterate that then it'll ensure that that dimension is measured and then nextly for the feeling there's many different indicators that we can measure whether that's heart rate whether that's sweating change in tone a bunch of different physical factors that we see the emotions changing and lastly we're asked to put this person in a real life scenario where they're consoling they're putting the interviewer in the position of the victim or the person who experiences a certain situation and they're consoling them for that situation that measures each different aspect and we have indicators for the compassion part for consoling and i think that we account for the subjectivity by having two people that are reviewing all this knowledge we have the interviewer who's experiencing it kind of more firsthand and seeing it and they're able to rate a person on a five point scale but then we also have the researcher who's kind of like an objective second view who can see this from afar", "improved_response": "I believe that to ensure these dimensions are accurately and fairly measured, we need to leverage different indicators, or pose different questions at various parts of the interview that cater to each aspect. For instance, we will have a section where the interviewer explains the situation, and then the participant is asked to paraphrase or summarize that situation. If they manage to address the key points, which include emotional aspects and an understanding of the situation's scope and context, then we can say that that dimension has been sufficiently measured. \n\nNext, for the feeling, there are many different indicators that we can measure, whether that's heart rate, sweating, change in tone, or a variety of different physical factors that indicate changing emotions. Lastly, we put this person in a real-life scenario where they are consoling the interviewer, who is in the position of the victim or the person experiencing a certain situation. This measures each different aspect and we have indicators for the compassion part, for consoling. \n\nI believe that we can account for the subjectivity by having two people review all this information. We have the interviewer, who is experiencing it more directly and observing up-close. They can rate the participant on a five-point scale. However, we also have a researcher, who serves as an objective second observer viewing from a distance."}, {"conversation_id": "65340a7ea275536b04453a29", "question": "Your response gives an insightful look into how you worked around the intrinsic subjectivity that arises in measuring empathy, Harrison.

The objective was to find a way to measure these dimensions holistically, rather than just focusing on the superficial level of understanding a situation. Concluding that simply summarizing a situation indicates empathy was not our aim. We wanted a more comprehensive assessment that expands on all three dimensions. \n\nI believe validity could be enhanced with more pilot testing, and by reviewing other research studies on empathy. If we were to broaden this research aspect, we could compare our operationalization with those utilized in other empathy studies. \n\nIn terms of reliability, it is crucial to have a clear and concise definition of the indicators we are looking for and determining the scope within which these indicators can be evaluated. This could be a simple 'yes' or 'no' in terms of whether they meet the set criteria. Furthermore, it's essential to provide specific training for both the researcher and interviewer to ensure they are on the same page during the interview process. This would enhance the reliability of our measurements."}, {"conversation_id": "65340a7ea275536b04453a29", "question": "Harrison, it's interesting how you've stressed having clear indicators and robust training for the researchers to ensure reliability in your measurements.

It would also involve people who are experts in this situation. I believe it's important to have this understanding from the experts, and then the experts can train and describe the specific indicators that we're looking for when we're examining the emotional aspect of it. They can also explain the different aspects to look for when we're considering compassion and how to console someone effectively. \n\nI think using reflexivity is an important skill, with the understanding that people may have specific biases originating from their backgrounds. These biases may specifically impact how they feel or how they'll express their feelings. Therefore, we must have different ways to measure those indicators of empathy. For instance, if someone is inherently emotional and reacts to just anything, we have to have a scope of understanding to measure this. \n\nConsequently, during this training, we have to ensure that the researcher and the interviewer gain a comprehensive understanding of what they're looking for, and establish common ground."}, {"conversation_id": "65340a7ea275536b04453a29", "question": "Your plan for researcher training to measure empathy is well thought out, Harrison.

For my study, I asked questions such as, \"Is this a description, either visual or literal, of someone you find attractive?\" The participants responded on a scale of 'strongly agree,' 'agree,' 'somewhat agree,' 'somewhat disagree,' 'disagree,' and 'strongly disagree.' I believe that the validity of this study is quite strong because it's straightforward to ascertain what participants find attractive. The variables are measuring what they should be, and the measurements will determine correlations in the subject. In other words, the validity is strong in this case because the study is effectively measuring what we aim to find out.

The dimensions of love include attachment, adoration, trust, and affection. Despite being often associated positively there are negative dimensions such as conflict, compromise, and sacrifice. People can express and experience in different ways including, romantic, platonic, and familial settings. \nAttachment means that you like having the person in our company and want to keep them around. You want to form a deeper connection with them. Adoration indicates the good feelings a person brings you. It leads to a deep sense of admiration and affection as a connection strengthens. Affection involves the many ways people show and express affection. This includes actions and gestures such as gifts, physical touch, spending time together, or giving words of affirmation. Trust involves a mutual understanding between two individuals. If a person trusts someone else they\u2019re deemed reliable or dependable in different circumstances. They have each other\u2019s back and have an awareness or understanding of another person\u2019s situation. \nConflict is prominent in love and building connections that foster it. This involves disagreements, arguments, or anything that stirs negative feelings between two individuals. As one of the more negative aspects of love, it\u2019s essential to work through conflict as it tests your connection. A willingness to fix conflict shows that a person wants to keep their love and relationship going, even when the going gets rough. \nCompromise and sacrifice work hand in hand. In love, compromise is when two people come together and find a solution that they both agree on in a problem or conflict. This can often lead to sacrifice, or one side giving up something for another side. Sacrifice comes into play during conflict and solving them, and it may become necessary for one side to give up something so both parties are satisfied or happy with the end results.  \nPlatonic love is love between friends, or without a romantic or sexual connection. Familial love is love shared amongst family members. It's often described as unconditional and built over years of company and support. Romantic love is a connection between a spouse and a partner. This type of love involves both emotional and physical attraction. There's a deep bond present in this type of love coupled with a desire for intimacy. \nA connection in these terms means a relationship amongst two or more groups of people. A relationship looks at how these individuals interact and behave around each other. \nA more positive relationship means a tighter connection, in which individuals often associate good feelings with each other. A negative relationship involves infrequent interaction or more negative feelings associated with each other. \n--\nIn a survey, I will ask people how many familial relationships they have on a scale from 0 to the maximum. I'll ask the same for both romantic and platonic relationships as well, trying to gauge how many close connections people have. \nI'll ask people to rank the average strength of a connection in those familial relationships on a scale of 1-10. I\u2019ll ask the same question for both romantic and platonic relationships. In this I\u2019ll provide a clear definition of closeness and a strong connection, citing things like shared experiences, support, and reliability. If people don\u2019t have one or more of these types of relationships, there will be a N/A option. \nThen I\u2019ll ask people to pick their closest relationship and define whether it\u2019s a familial, romantic, or platonic relationship. From there, I\u2019ll ask people to pick their closest relationship and define whether it\u2019s a familial, romantic, or platonic relationship. From there I\u2019ll have them rank on a scale of 1-10 how strong their feelings of adoration are in the relationship with that person. This repeats for the dimensions of attachment, trust, and presence of affection. I\u2019ll include the conceptual definitions and/or examples of these dimensions as written in the conceptualization portion.\nI\u2019ll also ask on a scale of 1-10 how severe conflicts are in the relationship and on a scale of 1-10 how they impact the relationship. I\u2019ll ask who often starts conflicts as well as who solves them with options being the person, their partner, or both parties. I also want to go into detail about the reasons for conflicts. I\u2019ll ask for the root of the conflict which will include, communication problems, personality differences, external circumstances, and others, which people can list out. For the already listed options, I'll define or include examples of these to make sure everyone understands it the same. I\u2019ll also ask if conflicts end more positively or negatively. \nSince everyone can harbor feelings of love and have close relationships with other individuals, getting as many people as possible is key in this experiment. A researcher would do this by spreading the survey to as many people as possible. Whether that's posting it to social media, sending the link to different groups, or asking random people on the street, getting the word out about the survey allows for a vast amount of results. I\u2019ll ensure that surveys remain anonymous and that we don\u2019t collect data on a person\u2019s name or other aspects of their identity. Another thing to emphasize is that everyone's connections, relationships, and perspectives of love are different.

This approach ensures that the participant, who may be in different situations or experiencing fluctuating emotions, provides consistent responses. By repeating a question and comparing the consistency of the answers, one can gauge the reliability of the data. If the respondent's answers remain consistent, it lends credibility to the survey. On the other hand, if the answers vary significantly, it suggests an inconsistency that may need to be addressed.\n\nAs researchers, we often find ourselves in a quandary, attempting to determine the underlying reasons why participants may change their answers. Pinning down the emotions or factors influencing these changes is crucial for understanding the outcomes. The challenge lies in achieving consistency; this is where the test-retest method becomes valuable. It helps us to begin assessing the consistency of the answers.\n\nUltimately, striving for consistency is essential for starting our research on a solid foundation.

Anger is an intense feeling of discontent, with discontentedness being a state of unenjoyment. Insecurity is the lack of fulfillment with oneself, which is feeling inadequate, as in not enough, often in comparison to others. Protectiveness stems from love or care for someone and the fear of losing them. It may be driven by the genuine concern one has for someone in their life. These various dimensions of jealousy interplay to result in the behavior of jealousy which can vary depending on context and situation such as romantic vs friendly relationships. Cultural norms and individual differences may also impact the way jealousy is displayed. Jealousy manifests in behaviors.\nOperationalization: \nI will be conducting a survey that uses the Likert Scale. This survey will be completed by college students like me because it is a time period where friendships and romantic relationships are very present, and as a result feelings of jealousy . The questions will address the dimensions of jealousy I chose of anger, insecurity, and protectiveness and how they are present for college students in various scenarios. The scenarios will be diverse and represent different relationship types along with a variety of jealousy triggers. There will also be scenarios that are non jealousy related which will act as my control measure.  I will make sure my scenarios are clear so there is no misunderstanding from students when reading them. After students are given a hypothetical scenario  they will pick a statement varying from strongly agree to strongly disagree based on the presence of the dimension given that aligns to them for that scenario. I would send out my survey through email on various college campuses across the country to get the best representation of college students living throughout different areas. I would also advertise it on college social media platforms. The survey will be open for three months to give people plenty of time to respond. The data would then be collected from what people selected on the Likert scale. From there averages and correlations would be made on how jealousy and its dimensions of anger, insecurity, and protectiveness correspond for college students in a variety of scenarios. The survey would be anonymous although the student will include valuable information such as their gender, age, college they attend, relationship status, and whether they have a big or small friend group. I will run a pilot test beginning at my local university to identify any flaws before releasing the study to more students. A consent form will be provided along with the promise of data security. My findings will then be published in research papers. An incentive of a raffle ticket for an Amazon gift card will be given to participants. Overall, there will be much focus in the wordings of the statement on the dimensions of anger, insecurity, and protectiveness. \n \n \n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706172324882, "student": {"_id": "6598daa0f619d8d44c5df9eb", "uid": "GCx0YPYqikWFrhrEGBG4mT0f5q33", "email": "sophaca@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704516256870, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Sophia Caldwell", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Oftentimes, for example, in a romantic relationship, someone may feel jealous if they suspect their partner is speaking to someone else behind their back. This jealousy can be rooted in protectiveness because they may genuinely love and care for their partner and want to ensure that everything is all right. It comes from a genuine place of care and concern, which is not entirely negative and leans more towards the positive side.\n\nSo, I wanted to make sure I was including more dimensions beyond just the basic negative connotations that often accompany it.

Choice is the process and ability to make decisions that align with one's own morals and values without the intervention of others.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI will survey people asking them a series of questing relating to autonomy.\n\nAn example of these questions would be, \"Do you generally comply with instructions? Scale of 1-5. Do you commonly disregard instructions? Scale of 1-5\"\n\nFor the dimension of:\n\nFreedom \"How much do you feel your school, family structure, or government restricts your behavior on a daily basis? Scale of 1-5.\" \"How often do you feel unable to express yourself freely in your institution? Use your own words\" \"How do you feel your ability to express yourself freely differs from your peers? This could relate to socioeconomic status, cultural differences, philosophical differences, and more. Use your own words\"\u00a0\n\nSelf-reliance\u00a0 \"How much do you generally belive your own instincts are trustworthy? Scale of 1-5\"\n\nChoice \"Are you a decisive person? Scale of 1-5. How important is it to you to make your own decisions? Scale of 1-5\"\n\nI would conduct a survey among school students in both High School and University asking them the questions above. This is a good sample group for my survey as students often have a low, or perceived low, level of autonomy. Before officially administering the survey I would first run a pilot test on a small group of both High School and University students to work out any issues with the study. I would also have a discussion with the participants before the study begins explaining that I am studying how Autonomous school students are, and how restricted they feel. I would explain that this survey is anonymous and that they can withdraw from the study at any time. I will collect non-identifying factors like age, gender, and socio-economic status. I would, however, make these optional to ensure comfort and anonymity in the study. I would also contact the IRB review board to obtain approval.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706224508392, "student": {"_id": "659f43528773d70a0156b167", "uid": "vwabU0Hy7xgFjkanOFBHfnmwFw22", "email": "maeves@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704936274439, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Maeve Smith", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Below is a revised version of the text with improved spelling and grammar:\n\nYes, well, I would say choice is arguably the most important among the dimensions I've discussed, because there is no autonomy without the ability to choose. I believe that the concept of choice is most closely related to freedom, as freedom essentially embodies the ability to make choices. To clarify, freedom represents the capacity to make one's own decisions, to act in a manner that one believes to be morally and ethically correct, and to pursue what is interesting, intriguing, and exciting at any given moment.\n\nIf there are restrictions on your actions that do not align with your own morals or values - if they are based on external sources or outside interventions - then you can't truly consider yourself free. I suppose this is where choice and self-reliance intersect. To be self-reliant is to trust in your own choices. It is to have confidence that the decisions you're making are right, or at least, to believe that you're making the best possible choices for the present moment. So, that's my perspective on how choice connects to freedom and self-reliance."}, {"conversation_id": "65b2e816e123e5924fa061c4", "question": "Maeve, you've made a compelling connection between freedom and choice, emphasizing their interdependence.

What I mean is that there are countless external factors that could limit your self-reliance, yet you still have the capacity to make decisions. For instance, a significant point that Chatzi brought up during my writing exercises was the impact of socioeconomic status. If you belong to a lower socioeconomic bracket, you technically possess the agency to make choices that could potentially alter your circumstances. Or, you could even just contemplate choices, such as theoretically deciding to take a vacation. However, without the financial means, you are unable to actually pursue that vacation. So indeed, socioeconomic status can greatly affect your ability to be self-reliant.\n\nFurthermore, socioeconomic status can shape your self-reliance in another way, despite having the capability to make choices. This discussion also touches on the relationship between interdependence and self-reliance. People from lower socioeconomic levels often depend more on their community, engaging more in collective activities and utilizing shared resources. You could argue that this reliance limits their capacity for self-reliance, as they cannot function without the support of their peers. In a lower socioeconomic environment, complete independence is often not viable.\n\nHowever, I would also contend that this does not necessarily hinder self-reliance. As I previously touched on, interdependence plays a vital role in the concept of self-reliance. There are numerous factors at play here.

Stress is the emotional and/or physical distress symptom(s) that is caused by perceived outside or internalized stressors that may have a wide range of causes- from emotional to physical. Trigger(s) in this context are the reasons for momentary or continuous stress, and these can be (but are not limited to) a certain fear, endangerment, or a personal trigger that isn\u2019t commonly identified as a trigger or others. Stressors are the actions, words, or sometimes certain items that cause stress to people. The cortisol hormone is the hormone that is produced in our bodies upon being exposed to a stressor or trigger. Emotional pressure is often verbally expressed, manipulating actions that cause an individual to experience a change in their emotions, actions, or stress levels. Overstimuli is when a stimulant is over something or someone\u2019s standard/acceptable limits of resistance to a reaction, and this could be both positive and negative. Coping mechanisms are either inherent/instinctual (like self-soothing postures) or methodical and taught ways (such as counted breathing exercises) to negate the effects of stress when exposed to stressors. \"\n\nOPERATIONALIZATION:\n\nI will be researching the accuracy of perceived stress during their time being on high ground versus how much cortisol production this correlates/ratios to in individuals. The phobia of high grounds is our trigger/stressor. The observation group will be 500 healthy individuals from ages 18 to 25 to avoid the possibility of acquiring less accurate bloodwork due to age-related natural factors that affect bodily functions/hormone synthesis. After all appropriate informed consent & disclosure processes are successfully completed, First, I will ask the participants about their description of the intensity of stress levels when they are on high ground in an open-ended question to determine the presence of any additional variables. They will also be asked about their awareness of their coping mechanisms and what they do if they are. Then, I will also ask them to rate this stress intensity on a scale of 1-10, as well as to rate the element of \u201cemotional pressure\u201d on the same scale. After revising/analyzing the open-ended questions and unique variables that the participants submitted into individual questions, those will also be asked to be rated individually on the same 1-10 scale. This includes questions about how well they think the coping mechanisms help their stress. We will then move on to an application experiment where the participants will give blood samples during a neutral, no experiment or stressor-related moment, and also right before and after climbing and descending from an indoor climbing wall (to test over stimuli thresholds). The researchers will also observe the coping mechanisms that the participants utilize throughout the entire process. (the input and observations will be then compared to determine the reliability of this method.) Finally, the numerical values of the cortisol present in their blood will be analyzed and averaged, and we will utilize this data on another scale of 1-10, proportionate to their percentages. This will allow us to compare and validate the perceived versus experienced intensity of stress that is caused by being on high ground. We will then compile all the data gathered to determine the average accuracy of the application group to finalize the research through a quantitative analysis. The results will be shared with the participants who opted in to be notified of the outcome.\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706226629367, "student": {"_id": "65975881f619d8d44c5df8c0", "uid": "zUKU9qB3jxdOExNUYN3cSEjd0FJ2", "email": "gunessun@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704417409861, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Gunes Alara Sun", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Creativity erupts from you independently and is then enhanced and put to use throughout time. Expression is a mode to show off your internal processes on the outside for yourself or others to see. Experimentation is method testing scenarios out through trial and error, with trial and error being a concept of trying something out with a hope for success but if not then running another option until you get the result you would like to acquire. Uniqueness is a speciality that differs something from something else to make it stand out or emphasize a point. Evolutionary is the idea of potentially changing over time and with that change supplying better or different scenarios that can be considered a new art. Art then is a wide ranging and boundless outlet that allows for people to manufacture, draw, and make something that comes to mind whether that be a message or sentiment of something else.\nI will hold a pilot testing with a randomized group of about 10 college students in pairs of two that will then end in a survey based on their performance and reflection of the interaction to measure creativity. Before the interaction the elected folks will need to provide informed consent verbally or in written form. I will then confirm that participants understand the meaning of informed consent and how they are not to be pressured to maintain in the study if they choose not to. Now how this process would work is the researcher would give all the pairs object like a dog, flower, and a phone to draw each in a 5 minute period. There will be an example photo of what each item looks like for everyone to have for reference. Also, participants have unlimited access to paper, different colored makers, erasers, and other art supplies they may need for drawing. Additionally, I (the researcher) will ask for eraser marks and pieces of paper used to be tracked by participants. After each of the 5 minutes the pair would swap drawings so they can see what the other came up with.  After a minute or so of observing the others work and brainstorming, the pairs will draw another dog, flower, and phone on their original paper with 5 minutes for each drawing again.  While the pairs are drawing I (the researcher) can observe their processes with my indicator for expression being the different colors, size, and shapes students used to create their dog. The indicator for uniqueness would be attributes that you don't necessarily connect with dogs. My indicator for the dimension of evolutionary would be eraser markings.  Lastly, my indicator for experimentation would be numbers of crumbled up papers. After the experiments are done the pairs will get the chance fill out a survey based on how they view their creativity from the scenario. In a survey I will ask students from strongly agree down to strongly disagree do you think your drawings demonstrated what you think of as a dog (for example)? Then I will ask students from completely agree to absolutely disagree, do you think your images were more unique than the example picture of a dog? With uniqueness defined as a speciality that differs something from something else to make it stand out or emphasize a point. Another question will be how many times did you erase your work? Lastly, I will ask how many times did you restart your work on a different sheet of paper? After the survey participants can share their take of the trial and provide feedback if necessary. This is an opportunity to debrief the process to fully explain the goal of the measurement of creativity and what indicators were observed by me (the researcher) during the process and to answer any last questions.\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706235171871, "student": {"_id": "65973057689349e1bde88f74", "uid": "y4X5r1pmARVLwOj5oP12zSeNYBu2", "email": "chachaej@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704407127199, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Chauncey Jones", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

I started to consider it later on. I was thinking about synonyms associated with creativity because people\u2014my family and friends\u2014often say that I am a creative person. As a result, I was looking for other words typically linked with creativity. Subsequently, I developed a conceptual definition of uniqueness based on my interpretation of the word and what specifically people find unique about what I do. \n\nI focused on the idea that when I create things for people, I often save scraps of paper and cut things in a unique manner, which differs from what others might do. This characteristic is unique because it is distinctive to me. For my experiment or measurement of uniqueness, I determined that an individual's creativity while drawing would be judged based on the provided sample. For instance, if the sample was a labradoodle\u2014a common dog breed\u2014then I would assess the person's drawing for unique attributes. Perhaps someone might add glasses to their dog drawing or turn the dog into a robot. Those additions would serve as indicators of uniqueness because they diverge from the prototype, the original model. \n\nIn my opinion, this deviation from the prototype defines uniqueness.

Take drawing a dog, for example. Even if it's not about adding glasses or turning the dog into a robot, if asked to draw a dog, I might choose a different breed, size, or color. These choices are still conventional, but it's unique because it represents how I perceive the concept of a dog in my own mind.\n\nSo, that's what I believe makes something unique\u2014our personal interpretation\u2014versus unconventional, which would be like the robot or adding glasses and other accessories.

Yesterday we discussed that, and my operational definition of evolutionary\u2014sorry, I thought it was asking me something different than what I actually had. So, yes, the indicator was eraser marks. My operational definition was to observe how many times someone erased their work during the process of drawing each of the pictures, such as a dog, a phone, or a flower. Sorry that it took me so long to explain.\n\nI determined its reliability because the context asks how one can be sure it's reliable. Well, it tests validity by showing that it actually measures creativity. I believe that when you're creative, you rarely get it right on the first try. It can be creative to you, but part of creativity is making specific aspects of something seem different. If someone saw it, they might think, \"Oh, I didn't consider it that way.\" That's why eraser marks were used to measure how trying something again allows you to show your creativity by making changes. For instance, if you drew something originally that was basic or conventional, then you erased it to try something else or to redo the same thing in a more creative light, if that makes sense.\n\nSo, you're not just basing your expression off what everyone else is doing. The reliability was determined by considering whether the participants understood the concept of fully erasing and whether a significant number of participants had similar numbers of eraser marks. It would show the evolutionary process and also suggest that not everyone is an artist, which is why I paired artistic ability with evolutionary. It shows that people make mistakes and try again in the creative process, which is, I think, a part of being creative. It involves seeing something that might not seem as creative or as close to what you want it to become, and then doing it again to show that creativity and achieve what you envisioned in the end."}, {"conversation_id": "65b3108ce123e5924f1b2b81", "question": "You've made an interesting point about the role of eraser marks in showcasing the evolutionary aspect of creativity.

It could indeed be the other way around; a more seasoned artist might erase more frequently because they are meticulous and focused on refining their work to enhance their creativity. In contrast, a novice might approach drawing with a carefree attitude, unconcerned with mistakes since the outcome is simply their own interpretation. This, I believe, is an essential part of the creative process.\n\nRegardless of skill level, we all make mistakes and strive to improve. In art, creativity empowers us to experiment. Such experimentation\u2014key to my conceptual definition of creativity\u2014allows one to demonstrate their capabilities. In the context of my study, it would reveal an individual's unique perspective on objects such as a dog, phone, or flower.\n\nI posit that both novice and experienced artists are likely to have eraser marks, which is why I consider them an indicator in my research. I assert that having the option to erase not only boosts creativity but also traces the evolution of the artist's thought process, illustrating where they started, where they intended to go, and their perseverance in reattempting to capture their original vision.

Firstly, I believe the chatbot did help me to frame my definitions both conceptually and operationally. The feedback provided allowed me to see aspects I hadn't considered before and helped me be more specific and descriptive in my definitions.\n\nAddressing the question from another angle, which I think might be the intended perspective, is considering the impact of a chatbot conducting my experiment. I believe a chatbot would influence the outcomes because, for example, if I showed it a picture of a dog, the AI might not be as creative. Since a chatbot bases its knowledge on other people's inputs, it lacks original creativity, even though creativity can emerge from references or influences.\n\nI think a chatbot could potentially affect my experiment's outcome because it would rely solely on other people's perspectives to create a drawing. However, it might be interesting to observe how a chatbot amalgamates various references to create something unique. Therefore, my concerns would involve the sources of the chatbot's references and the need to narrow its scope, so it does not draw from an excessively wide range of dog breeds, sizes, and so forth.\n\nAdditionally, since the chatbot is an AI system, it might not make the same errors humans do, such as leaving eraser marks or indications of paper texture, which could affect the reasonableness of the results. These are significant concerns\u2014ensuring the chatbot's output reflects strength and uniqueness in expression could be challenging, as it's based on previous examples.\n\nIn essence, navigating the aspects of evolutionary development and experimentation could be particularly tricky and concerning in my experiment, especially when evaluating the AI's implementation and its capacity to test creativity."}]}, "65b31399e123e5924f233ec0": {"_id": "65b31399e123e5924f233ec0", "created_at": 1706234777864, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "Conceptualization: Grief encompasses feelings of sadness and loss, manifested in various ways. It can temporarily dominate one's life, causing unhappiness. Processing grief involves recognizing its different forms and taking steps to cope.\u00a0Grief is hard to process for everyone and it's important to not go through it alone, seek support through your friends, family, or a therapist. You have to give yourself time to heal and acknowledge it's okay to feel the feelings you are feeling. It often arises from loss and loss is a key element of grief. Grieving can carrying the experience sadness the feeling of sorrow, unhappiness or a sense of loss. Loss is the experience of being deprived of something or someone and it can be seen in various forms like the loss of a loved one, the loss of a job, or the absence of a cherished possession. Losing someone you were close with and the connections you had with one another could cause you grieving. Along with losing a job you loved and thought highly of, having that taken away from you, out of your control, could cause grieving. Loss is a human experience that more than half of the world experiences and everyone has been in that scenario of loss leading to grief; this helps with grief knowing people have been in the same position as you. These emotions, loss and sadness, are all within the concept of grief and within the different universal aspects of the human experience and human emotions when experiencing grief.\u00a0\n\nOperationalization: I will first ask people if they have experienced grief throughout their life on a scale of 1 to 10. I could explain to participants when ranking their experience on a scale of 1 to 10, consider that '1' represents minimal impact and '10' represents the most profound impact. After each question is asked I will highly encourage participants to share any specific emotions and thoughts that contributed to their ranking in order to collect richer qualitative responses. I know that there are subjective interpretations of the scale that may vary among individuals so I'll have to keep that in mind asking, \"Can you provide more details on what a '5' on the scale looks like to you? Make sure to consider your own participation when responding.\" for all the different scales throughout the survey. I could also ask, \"Has your grief intensity changed over time?\". Since you're able to experience grief in various ways everyone's scale could be different but having people mention they have experienced the same kind of grief their rankings could be similar. I will ask what the participant's cultural background is, what are their personal coping mechanisms, or support systems and see if there are any potential factors influencing their scale of grief. I will then repeat these steps for loss and sadness. Asking if they have experienced this emotion throughout their life, what it was, and rank on a scale of 1 to 10 how it made them feel. People can feel sadness but not have it necessarily have to do with grief so this could add error to my findings. When considering and ranking your experiences of sadness and grief realize grief often involves more of a prolonged and complex process associated with loss. While sadness is typically a temporary emotional response to something that has happened or an event in your life. For sadness, I could ask what was a point in your life you felt the most sad and that could correlate to grief more. I could question them to see whether or not they had any social support during the times they felt the most sad and how the support impacted their experience. Adding follow-up questions to explore and see how the support specifically impacted their experience of sadness. The questions being asked will be open-ended questions because this will allow participants to express their real experiences to the fullest.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706236209612, "student": {"_id": "6598dc7bf619d8d44c5df9ee", "uid": "TcFF02vROGSqoFhzRrQsGoj1an92", "email": "akilif@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704516731312, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Akili Foster", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

I feel that grief is a powerful emotion experienced by many, and the prospect of conducting research or a survey on this topic intrigued me. By implementing an ordinal method and asking participants to rate their emotions, there is an opportunity to gain insight into their personal experiences with grief. This approach allows a glimpse into how individuals from different backgrounds may experience grief in varied ways.\n\nI am fortunate that I have not endured grief in an extreme form, which makes the chance to listen to others describe their unique experiences and coping mechanisms both enlightening and valuable. Understanding different grieving processes not only feeds my curiosity but also prepares me to empathize with others who face loss.\n\nFurthermore, I find it particularly interesting to learn about the factors that influence how people rank the intensity of their grief; such as the context in which they experienced it, their relationship to the person they lost, and the nature of the loss itself.

I contend that this aspect of my upbringing has shaped the way I process and handle grief, distinguishing my experience from those who were raised differently or within other cultural contexts.\n\nI have observed that many cultures also instill a strong sense of resilience, which can result in a group experiencing grief differently compared to other cultural groups. Therefore, by including this as one of the dimensions, it would provide valuable insights into how individuals' perceptions of grief may vary based on their cultural backgrounds.\n\nMoreover, by posing more open-ended questions, we can explore and understand the reasons behind these differences.

I asked participants to rank their grief intensity on a scale from one to ten, where one represented a specific meaning to them, and ten represented another.

Recognizing that everyone's 'five' might differ, this question added to the reliability because I could comprehend each participant's unique perspective.\n\nTo further ensure the reliability of my scale, I used both qualitative and quantitative data.

However, this might affect the study because everyone expresses grief differently. Since there are no equal intervals\u2014like I mentioned before\u2014someone's grief at a ten could be analogous to another person's grief at a one.

This sense of privacy can encourage a more candid expression of emotions and experiences across different grief scenarios. I believe that this could lead to the collection of not only more data but also more accurate and detailed data, as people are likely to feel a greater sense of personalization in their responses. \n\nWe've discussed this in another module: the way in which people are currently hesitant to share their true feelings, fearing judgment or exposure. By providing a confidential platform where one can share freely behind a screen, the perceived level of personalization increases. Using a chatbot for this purpose, despite the anonymity that already exists in research, may encourage even richer feedback. People might be more willing to divulge more information to an AI, enhancing the quality and volume of the data collected. \n\nChatbots can administer questions instantly and without creating an uncomfortable atmosphere that might arise if a researcher were to ask questions in person. Even when anonymity is assured, the simple presence of another person can influence responses. So yes, I believe that using chatbots, which eliminates this direct human element, could result in more extensive and profound data collection."}]}, "65b314ebe123e5924f2dcd77": {"_id": "65b314ebe123e5924f2dcd77", "created_at": 1706235115487, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "Trust is the ability and choice to place your faith into someone over a period of time through transparency. A rudimentary and visual way of expressing trust is to do a trust fall. Ability is having the capacity to do something. Faith is placing your confidence in something or someone. Time is a specific allotment of seconds, minutes, days, weeks, or years. Transparency is possessing a quality of frankness, typically not lying or deceiving, and upon lying or deceiving, being upfront about it. A trust fall is between two people, and involves one person voluntarily falling backward into the other person's arms. Trust can theoretically be rated on a scale of 1-10, with 1 as completely untrustworthy, and 10 you would trust them with your life. \n \nI would set up an observational study to observe people of different ages, with various backgrounds. In each age group, one person would identify as male and one person would identify as female. At least one of the people in each group would be a person who has had an upbringing with some sort of emotional trauma present in it. Emotional traumas could include PTSD, abuse, or the experience of divorce. The first age group would be 4-18, the second group  19-35, the third group 37-55, and the older group (56+). In this study, each person would have 3 people that they pick. One person will be someone that the subject considers to be very trustworthy to them, the next person will be someone that they consider to be a medium level of trustworthy, and the last person will be someone that the subject does not consider trustworthy.  \"Trustworthiness\" will be defined as someone you would rely on over a period of time. The subjects will conduct \"trust falls\" with each of the 3 people they have picked. They will conduct trust falls with each person 5 times. It will be ensured that participants are briefed on what a trust fall is, how it works, and that they are comfortable with it. Each time before the trust fall, they will ask \"will you catch me\", and then after the trust fall have the person explain why they did or did not catch the subject. Both before and after the trust falls, the subjects will rate each indicator (ability, faith, time, and transparency) on a scale of 0-10. They will rate ability based upon how able and willing the person will be to catch them. They will rate faith on how much confidence they have in them. Time will be rated on how the subject's trust in their 3 people progressed or did not progress over time. Transparency will be rated on whether the subject feels like their 3 people will lie or did lie at any given point before, after, or during the trust fall process. The numeric answers from the four indicators of ability, faith, time, and transparency will be added up for each of the three chosen people for each of the trustworthiness categories, and then given a number of how their trust for the person started and ended.

Grief is an individualized experience of emotion evoked in someone through different forms and can be to various extents. Sorrow is an immense amount of emotional pain, which pain is something that causes someone to hurt. Anger is something that makes people feel a sense of pain and discomfort both emotionally and physically. Numbness is a state of losing your sense of emotions entirely.\n\nOperationalization:\u00a0\n\nI want to see what dimension of grief: sorrow, anger, or numbness is the most common dimension among a group of students at UW who lost someone close to them.\u00a0 I want to know after one day, week, and month, the emotional experiences they faced with the three dimensions. Since everyone's grief is an individualized experience and can vary in different forms and extents, I want to determine the most common dimension understood between students at UW who experience this type of grief. This is a good sample for my study because everyone will be in the same relative age group and have relatively similar experiences of losing someone whether it be a parent, grandparent, friend, etc. In a survey, I will ask questions in relation to all three dimensions. Surveys involve asking questions to a large group of people. This survey aims to measure the degree to which the dimensions of sorrow, anger, and numbness are felt by each person experiencing grief. All three are impactful and the goal is to understand how each respective dimension plays a role in the impact of grief overall.\u00a0 This survey is measured in intervals. Intervals are successive points of a scale with equal intervals. In my survey, the intervals will be 1-10. First I will ask an introductory open-ended question, \"What was your relationship with the deceased?\"\u00a0\nThen I will go into questions such as \"On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how angry did you feel on the first day?\" Following that, I will ask the same question, but during the first week and first month, and then repeat the questions with the other two dimensions.\u00a0 Here is the list of questions I would ask:\n1. What was your relationship with the deceased?\n2. On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how angry did you feel on the first day?\n3. On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how angry did you feel for the first week?\n4. On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how angry did you feel for the first month?\n5. On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how sorrowful did you feel on the first day?\n6. On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how sorrowful did you feel for the first week?\n7. On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how sorrowful did you feel for the first month?\n8. On a scale of 1-10, after you lost someone close to you, how numb did you feel on the first day?\n9.

These three dimensions represent what grief is as a concept, at least to me. Although bargaining and acceptance are part of the stages, I don't think they capture the early experiences of grief very well. The study I wanted to discuss focuses on how individuals feel in the first month of grief. Acceptance is clearly not typical during the first month, and I believe that bargaining is a challenging concept, or rather, a dimension that is hard to understand and tackle.\n\nTherefore, I think sorrow, anger, and numbness are more accessible ways of illustrating what grief truly entails."}, {"conversation_id": "65b3187ae123e5924f4e02e0", "question": "I can see how your personal experience has deeply influenced your focus on sorrow, anger, and numbness.

For example, I wanted to ask the following question concerning each dimension of the experience: \"How angry did you feel when you lost someone on the first day?\"; then, \"How angry did you feel when you lost someone in the first week?\"; and finally, \"How angry did you feel when you lost someone in the first month?\"\n\nI posed these three questions addressing the emotions of anger, sorrow, and numbness.

By posing similar questions focused on each of these dimensions, the inquiry becomes more specific, allowing a more thorough exploration of the concepts and a better understanding of grief as a whole, with all its different dimensions at play.\n\nI ensured validity and reliability in the following ways: For validity, I considered face validity\u2014the apparent effectiveness of the study in measuring grief at a glance\u2014and I believe that on a surface level, my study offers a credible means of quantifying grief. Given that grief is inherently subjective, and my study leans towards qualitative research, quantifying it with face validity using an interval scale, and ensuring that the content accurately reflects the dimensions, seems effective.\n\nAs for reliability, the clarity of the questions contributes to the study's reliability. The survey is concise, avoiding participant fatigue that could negatively impact reliability. The research is consistent, with clear and understandable directions.\n\nThe potential reliability issue I foresee is that different groups of people might yield different results when taking the test. However, I believe this variation stems from the subjective nature of the survey. Ideally, if the survey were to be administered to a similar demographic, such as WSU students within the same age bracket, the results would be comparable.

So, I think that could be an issue. And how would I control for these in my study design? I don't know. I think it would be kind of difficult to control for those in your study. Because, I guess, what I would do is use the test-retest method. Not exactly test-retestment, but I would ask the group to answer the survey again in a month's time, just to give them time to think about it and see how their answers change.

Power is about being in a position to make decisions. Agency can be defined as the ability to take action, and more specifically, personal agency is the ability to take action in accordance to personal beliefs and values. Personal beliefs and values are a person's outlook on life and what they see as wrong or right. The ability to express autonomy can be limited in certain situations, since it changes depending on social or societal contexts.

Responses would be anonymous to ensure people feel safe to answer questions about autonomy. A researcher would observe this by viewing responses to the survey and seeing what percent of people chose each answer for a given question. These results would also be compared to social categories selected at the end of the survey, to see if aspects such as gender, age, and race correlate with self-perceived autonomy. The open-ended question at the end of the survey would be analyzed to see if responses provided any additional context or called for further surveying by creating new questions. In addition to this, it would be given quantitative measurements to better compare it to the rest of the survey. This would be done through finding repeated terms/concepts or themes that were brought up by respondents. Coding responses would be done in a qualitative nature, for example, 'X number of participants brought up ideas of upbringing or familial influences in regards to beliefs about autonomy.' The interpretations of open-ended responses would have to be critiqued/looked over by others to ensure lack of personal opinions/beliefs/biases in interpreting the date.

Those who teach us \u2013 what they like, what they believe in, and what they consider morally correct \u2013 often sway our perception of morality. Consequently, this may impact someone's ability to exercise personal agency. For instance, an individual might hold specific opinions, but if their loved ones or wider society harbor vastly different views, it becomes challenging to deviate from those societal norms and express personal opinions and decisions aligned with one's morals.\n\nParticularly with respect to autonomy, environmental factors or external influences can sometimes restrict an individual's autonomy, notably in scenarios involving laws and social norms that may prevent one from expressing their self-governance."}, {"conversation_id": "65b31b15e123e5924f6ae9b1", "question": "Anna, you've articulated the influence of external factors on personal agency well.

Through pilot testing, you can obtain feedback and determine whether this final question is indeed effective. It allows you to see if it accomplishes what you intended or if it needs further refinement.\n\nTherefore, I believe pilot testing is highly significant for this process, and I made sure to include it when explaining the operational definition.

This feedback is generated from online sources, and I have no means to verify the reliability or impartiality of these sources because I don't know where the chatbot is sourcing its information from within the broader Internet.

Reflecting on this feedback can be useful, as it might supply new ideas, prompt clarification, or encourage adding more depth to responses. Nevertheless, in conducting an actual survey or research study, obtaining feedback from real people with real-life experiences is invaluable.

Like happiness, hope is also a state of being and can be experienced through different degrees. The feeling of excitement is mainly present when someone thinks about the short term future, when they want something to happen and cannot wait the future event. For example when your mom tells you she is bringing home ice cream later in the day and you get excited and happy with the anticipation that ice cream is coming. Desire refers to the deep feeling of want and in my opinion, the timeline is in between short and long term. For example when you talk to your friends about what your plans are after college and you explain how you desire to start working as an investment banker. And Dream is when someone wants something so bad, it becomes their fantasy, their end goal, their vision, the long term. For example when you think about your life as a whole and you think about how people want to remember you, you tell people you dream to make a serious impact on world hunger in the future. (Which cannot be done in medium or short term)\n\n\nOperationalization:\u00a0To start, I will create a survey and run a small pilot test to see if there are any issues, then I would go onto a larger scale. My set of questions will fall into the categories of excitement, desires, and dreams. Then I would have participants rate how true these statements are to them on a scale of 1-10 and rather than just giving them a scale of 1-10, I will be more specific by defining what the scale means by stating that 1 means not true at all and 10 being completely true. \u00a0For example, for excitement, I would ask a question like \"I energetically pursue my goals.\" This question will tell me how much excitement someone has for something. For the desire category of questions I might ask something like \"I have an Idea of what I want to do 5 years from now,\" Which would tell me about their desires. And finally for their dreams I might ask something like \"I want to ultimately make some sort of impact on the world in my lifetime.\" \u00a0my survey might bring up social desirability bias, which participants may answer in a way they seem is socially \u00a0correct, so to combat this, I will make the survey completely anonymous and of course, obtain informed consent from participants. Then at the end of the entire questionnaire, in order to gather more relevant information, I may ask some open ended questions for students to write more about their hopes. we can then rate the participants on each of the categories of excitement, desire and dream, to get a score out of each one. The method in which we will use to come up with the scores is simple, just add up every number from every question to get the sum of each dimension.

This holistic perspective captures the multifaceted nature of accountability, highlighting its significance across various contexts. Scrutinizing accountability demands a nuanced lens that focuses on the distinct aspects of responsibility, transparency, and consequence. Responsibility analysis combines quantitative measures like task completion rates and supervisor evaluations with qualitative observations of role fulfillment, including proactive problem-solving, and interview explorations of individual responsibility perception. Transparency employs quantitative methods like timestamping of reports and content analysis of justifications alongside qualitative observations of communication behavior, such as openness to feedback, and focus group discussions on information-sharing practices. Finally, consequence utilizes pre- and post-action questionnaires for predicting impacts and self-reported accountability alongside observations of mitigation efforts, learning from mistakes, and holding oneself and others accountable.

Personality is more internal and consists of the person's inward qualities such as their emotions, thoughts and behavior. Beauty embodies different cultures and is rooted on the diversified world we live in. \nI would conduct two surveys for the two dimensions in my conceptual definition. One survey would be based on physical beauty. I would show my research group headshots of different people with different beauty standards and ask them to rate each headshot on a scale from 1 to 10. I would also add in a section where the participant can answer an open ended question, which would ask \"what physical qualities do you consider 'beautiful'?\" The second survey would be based on internal beauty. I would list different characteristics and personality traits and ask my research group to rate them on a scale from 1 to 10 as well. In addition, I would add in another open ended question, which would ask \"what internal qualities or personality traits do you consider 'beautiful'?\" The rankings for the scale would be specific. I would make 1-2 signify that they are ugly and unattractive, 3-4 meaning that the person is still unattractive but not totally ugly, 5-7 meaning that the person is attractive but still has some ugly attributes and 8-10 being that they are the most attractive and pleasurable person ever.

Friendship is a stable interpersonal relationship that has multiple degrees that diminish or deepen depending on the degree of interpersonal joy, trust, helpfulness, similarity, and the length of time that maintains the state of friendship.\n\nJoy means feeling happy to stay with the people that people identify as having friendships through ways like sharing laughter. As a real-life example, people would define as having friendships with those who can feel good and laugh together when they are together.\n\nTrust means feeling secure when staying with the people that people identify as having friendships, both physically and psychologically, that are established and deepened over time by behaviors such as keeping secrets, keeping bodies safe, etc. As a real-life example, people would define as having friendships with those who can keep their secrets well, or save them from school bullies.\n\nHelpfulness means the willingness to save the people who identify as having friendships from physical or psychological danger or let them improve in life, such as the willingness to give out emotional support when at their lowest point or provide resources or advice that contribute to the growth and development of the individual. As a real-life example, people would\u00a0define as having friendships with those who give good advice in their studies to help them get better grades.\n\nSimilarity means sharing the same identities between people who identify as having friendships, such as having the same interests, the same jobs, the same punch line, etc. As a real-life example, people would define as having friendships with those who are often amused by the same jokes.\n\n\n\n\nIn the survey, I would like to ask the participants:\n\nHow many friends do you have, which participants can give a number from 0 to as many friends as they want.\n\nIf the participants did not write 0, which indicates they have at least one friend, I would like to ask them the following questions for each friend:\n\nHow many days have you been friends with this friend, which participants can give a number from 0 to as many days as they want.\n\nIn the dimension of joy,\n\nHow much joy did you have with this friend, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nHow good do you feel when you're with this friend, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nHow often do you laugh when you spend time with this friend, with the selection of \"never, seldom, sometimes, often, usually, always,\" which would be transferred on a scale of 0-5.\n\nIn the dimension of trust,\u00a0\n\nHow much do you trust this friend to keep your secrets, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nHow much do you trust this friend to come to your aid when your life is in danger, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nIn the dimension of helpfulness,\u00a0\n\nHow willing are you to help this friend, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nIf you've helped this friend, how helpful do you, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nHow willing do you believe this friend will help you, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nIf this friend has helped you, how helpful is this friend, on a scale of 0-5.\n\nIn the dimension of similarity.\u00a0\n\nHow much do you believe that you have in common with this friend, on a scale of 0-5.\n\n\n\n\nI would first conduct a survey through questionnaires for my close friends, because I would be able to determine that I have a friendship with them.

It only took a couple of seconds for it to generate examples or feedback. However, I believe the issue with chatbots is that they don't offer any human insight or feedback, which I think can sometimes be more important. Chatbots have a kind of set pattern, so if I say something, the chatbot's response is predictable. Compared to a human, if I say the same thing, there's a range of potential responses that a human could give. Human feedback allows for diverse interpretations, which I consider to be really important. Having different kinds of feedback from different people is valuable. As I mentioned before, a chatbot will produce a specific response to a given input, and that's all it can do.

Analysis is the act of using critical thinking and previously learned knowledge to decode the message, information, and data presented in the media, deconstructing media into its intended message. Evaluation is the act of assessing the media and understanding the effect on the audience. Production is an individual's ability to create any form of media fluently and the ability to convey and disseminate your intended message in the media. Media of all forms includes digital, print, audio, video.\n\nMy study would be split into 3 parts to measure each dimension properly.\n\nPart 1: Analysis\n\nResearch subjects would be given an article that is trying to persuade the reader of something using techniques typically seen in 'fake news' like deception and fallacies and they would have to analyze the article see if they are able to point out where the author used techniques to persuade them and they would be evaluated on a scale of 0-10  of how many things they have pointed out (0 being none pointed out and 10 being all pointed out). A correct analysis would be defined as comments that showcase a deep understanding of material and how a fallacy/deception was used to influence the reader, for example: \"When the author said 'those who argue for the protection of the Black community must be anti-white.' the author is using a strawman fallacy to influence the reader's opinion.\"\n\nPart 2: Evaluation\n\nResearch subjects would write a short reflection on the previous article specifically asking them if they could see how if the article was released to a mass audience what effect it would have on the audience and if they think the general public would be able to see through the deceptive/persuasion points. The responses would be evaluated on a scale of 0-10 on how insightful their reflection was. (0 being no insight and 10 being they are able to understand the nuance of mass media communication). Insight would be measured by how it compares to other responses as well as how it compares to the author's own justification of technique used.\n\nPart 3: Production\n\nResearch subjects would be given a set of information and they would have to use the information to write a short article or produce any form of mass media of choice and they would be evaluated on a scale of 0-10 (of 0 being not accurate at all to 10 as most accurate) of how accurately they conveyed the message. Accuracy would be evaluated on how well a 3rd party is able to understand and is able to evaluate/analyze the media produced.\n\nI would conduct this study on three types of individuals. Those who are the \"average joe\", individuals with no media expertise. Those who are going under media education, like journalism majors. Lastly, media industry professionals like senior journalists and individuals that have been in PR/media industry for over 10 years.\n\nThe researcher would observe the results of these three types of individuals and there should be a correlation between how advanced their media literacy is and their experience in media.

The dimension of physical conformity would be physical similarities that can be identified by sight alone, like how the individual dresses, their body language, posture, etc.. The dimension of social conformity would be similarities in mindset and/or opinion.\n\nThere are 2 dimensions being tested: Physical and social (mental) conformity.\n\nDress can be observed by the researcher. Should be split between type of clothes and color of clothes. For type of clothes start with shirt vs no shirt (other). If shirt, long sleeve vs short sleeve. Then move on to pants vs no pants (other). Then long vs short for both the pants and no pants option. For color, ask twice: once for top, once for bottom. Question can be open ended but only accept a \"full color\" answer where the full color is one of the 12 colors of the basic color wheel. The question for color should be \"What color would you say best fits your top/bottom clothes?\" If answer given is not on the color wheel, further prompt with the question \"Would you say [color from color wheel that researcher believes best fits with their answer] is about right?\"\n\nSocial conformity can be tested with a questionaire. It should be an interview with a researcher, with questions focusing on social norms and societal values. The questions should start off with simple yes/no or true/false questions. Later on, the questions should ask the same thing but be open ended. This serves two purposes: it is the \"test-retest\" method for reliability and it is easier to notice changes in body language, facial expression, etc. in open ended questions.\n\nOne question that must be asked between the close-ended and open-ended question is about comfort with language between English and their \"native tongue\" (if applicable). The format should be a Likert scale.\u00a0\n\nThe easiest method to conduct the experiment would be to have participants sign up and visit a location for the \"interview\".

I've attended numerous classes on it, especially within the context of communications; I have a keen interest in intercultural communication, and conformity was a significant part of my studies. I did so much reading on the subject that I felt I knew it well, which is why I chose to focus on conformity. However, as I began to delve deeper into the topic, I encountered new complexities.\n\nIn the initial quizzes and assignments, I proposed that conformity could be split into three dimensions: physical, mental, and social. This categorization is somewhat analogous to the three states of well-being\u2014physical, emotional, and mental\u2014but I replaced emotional with social, as emotional conformity seemed too challenging to operationalize.\n\nI abandoned the mental dimension after realizing its close resemblance to the social aspect. It seemed far easier to combine them into a singular social dimension. Starting with physical conformity, I considered the typical expectations in Western societies like the US; for example, a man is expected to wear a shirt and pants. However, in different cultures, such as some African countries or perhaps Ireland, seeing a man in a skirt or a dress can be normalized, highlighting a variant form of conformity.\n\nThen I contemplated whether physical conformity should encompass inherent physical traits, like skin color, but recognized the sensitive nature of this line of inquiry and chose not to engage with it. Instead, I limited my focus to changeable aspects, such as clothing.\n\nAt the suggestion of \"Chad JBT,\" I included in my revision the idea that physical conformity also involves reactionary physical aspects.

I think this was related to ordinal measurements or an ordinal measurement, to be precise. I have to double-check the quiz. I believe I answered it correctly there. It's frustrating; I deleted something.\n\nSo, I start with the ordinal measurements because they provide hard data and are very easy to collect. But also, these things are not truly ordinal, right? They involve degrees, so it would be more accurate to describe them as ratio measurements. That's where the open-ended questions come into play, but it's really hard to quantify that. So, I initially split the approach into the simple \"yes-no\", and then we'll gradually transition to the ratio measurements. That would also serve as a test-retest for their original measurement answers.\n\nI was also thinking, why not double up and test for their physical conformity\u2014their body language, etc.\u2014when they are answering these questions? We can observe whether, if they all answer in the same way, it might indicate they don't really believe what they're saying or quite the opposite\u2014they truly believe it. The use of a Likert scale in the middle was because ChatGPT also mentioned language as a type of conformity, right?\n\nFor language, I was considering an ordinal approach, like asking, \"How comfortable are you speaking English?\" with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" But then I wondered about the degree of \"yes\" and the degree of \"no.\" Hence, I switched to a Likert scale. So, on a scale of maybe one to five or one to ten\u2014with one being not comfortable and ten being very comfortable, or perhaps one representing your other language, your native tongue, and ten representing English, if applicable\u2014how comfortable are you? This serves as another data point and addresses the issue of a single measure of conformity.\n\nWhat worries me, though, is that for this particular aspect, we lack a test-retest method. Right? Nonetheless, conducting it this way does test for conformity.\n\nThe other issue with this question is its relevance for individuals who don't have a native tongue other than English. For them, this question might be moot. If that's the case, then their language conformity isn't something we can test because there's only one language present. That's why I noted in my answer to only ask about their comfort with English \"if applicable.\""}, {"conversation_id": "65b33486e123e5924faad3d4", "question": "Kyle, it's interesting how you're considering the nuances of language comfort in measuring conformity.

So, when considering language conformity within a measure like .com, it will appear to be very high because they only speak English, right? How can I test for conformity with a different language if they solely speak English? It simply doesn't work.\n\nYes, I suppose if they do speak a second language that isn't their native tongue or a part of their culture \u2014 perhaps they learned Spanish in high school \u2014 you might be able to conduct a test. However, they're always going to prefer English, so their comfort with that language could be a potential workaround. But that is entirely different from someone whose first language is different from English.\n\nThe point is, you're just reversing which is the native and which is the foreign language. So, in terms of language conformity, that is data, yes, but it relates to a different question. The operationalization, I guess you would call it, is completely different.

I also utilized an interval system, such as the Likert scale. This meant I would get a range of responses. However, when I attempted to combine the variables to produce a clear outcome, like an average or total score, it became quite difficult to create a numerical system that could be consolidated due to the different levels of measurement.\n\nConsequently, the validity of my study was likely to be compromised because it wasn't accurately capturing what I hoped to, and the reliability could be low, lacking a structure that would consistently produce regular patterns. With this realization, I decided to redefine, or rather, re-operationalize my dimensions and survey questions to all use the same level of measurement\u2014specifically, the Likert scale for all of them.\n\nAs a result, I believe that my study will have greater validity and reliability.

It advised that incorporating some negative queries could help mitigate bias. This feedback was invaluable as it allowed me to amend my survey to better reflect a balanced approach. Additionally, ChatGPT highlighted certain dimensions that I had failed to define. Consequently, I was able to include and elucidate these elements, as they were somewhat lacking or prone to misinterpretation in their previous state.\n\nWith these revisions in mind, I anticipate that the chatbot's assistance will positively influence respondents' comprehension of and engagement with the survey.

Here's the text with corrected spelling and grammar:\n\n\"Communication is fundamentally about the exchange of information among people, through various mediums, and across different aspects. In the realm of communication, trust plays a vital role because the more we reveal about ourselves, the more someone else is entrusted with that knowledge, and the deeper the mutual understanding becomes. Therefore, in terms of trust, honest communication is critical. It demonstrates that I am willing to be open, to share my concerns and fears, and that I trust the other person will be receptive. When I can express myself freely and honestly, it signals to the other person that they can do the same, allowing us to work through issues or for them to offer guidance and support.\n\nThis transparency is crucial because it establishes a foundation for trust. By consistently engaging in honest dialogue, trust builds over time. Of course, this dynamic varies across different types of relationships. For example, with our parents, whom we have known for a long time and with whom we have, presumably, developed a sense of trust through honest communication, trust is likely to be stronger. However, not everyone is honest with their parents, and in such cases, trust may be weaker.\n\nIn romantic relationships, we often strive for honesty and vulnerability from the outset. We don't want our partners to harbor doubts or insecurities about us; instead, we want to grow and learn together.\n\nConversely, in the workplace, complete honesty may not always be the best policy. While there are aspects of work that we can commiserate over with colleagues, like the difficulty of the job, we tend to be more guarded about other feelings. For instance, we wouldn't confess to hating our job to a coworker we don't trust, as it could be used against us. If a superior finds out, it might cost us our job. Therefore, the level of honesty we practice at work often depends on the circumstances and our relationships with individual colleagues.\""}, {"conversation_id": "65b33977e123e5924fc37fb7", "question": "You've given a clear explanation on how the level of honesty in communication varies with the type of relationship, Priscille.

Here's the revised text with corrected spelling and grammar:\n\nYes, so with honesty, if we are very honest, it obviously impacts the stability of trust to a greater extent. If we openly share every single aspect of our lives and are honest about it with someone else, they know there's nothing to fear about us. They see us as an open book; knowing so much about us reduces their anxiety or fears, as there are fewer lies and they have a better understanding of who we are.\n\nFor example, take the small honesty at work, where we may be honest about how we feel regarding the job but not about our personal lives. We don't delve much into that, so there isn't as much stability because the only commonality is that you both shared that same job and were honest about how you felt about it. However, we don't really know much about you outside of work; there's no other connection.\n\nThis is why certain relationships last: because we are able to learn different aspects of someone and understand them as a whole person. By knowing this, we accept them for who they are and choose to include them in our lives. Without this broader connection, there is no real stability, because the moment you leave that job, the connection may weaken. People often feel close while working together, but not as much afterward, because nothing deeper was established.\n\nIn contrast, consider a romantic relationship where connections are continuously built, honesty is nurtured, and bonds deepen because you care about the person and want to be honest to make the relationship work. There's more stability because they know that even if there's conflict, the issue can be addressed, thanks to the presence of honesty and vulnerability.\n\nIn terms of the parent-child relationship, it varies. Sometimes we start off being very honest with our parents, then gradually we only share superficial details, leading to a somewhat unstable relationship. We may feel that if we share certain things, they might not like us as much or agree with us, creating instability and dishonesty. Even if we feel we know them well enough, the relationship may not be as strong, and there won't be the same level of deep trust that one might have with a romantic partner.\n\nWith friendships, if you're both deeply involved in each other's lives regardless of circumstances, you can be more honest because of the support you've provided one another over time. However, if there is a friendship where you've spent time apart and you feel that being honest might hurt you in some way, there will likely be stability issues. You might feel disconnected, as if you no longer have much in common, which leads you to question why you should share your deepest concerns, dreams, and feelings.\n\nUltimately, the level of honesty you choose to have with people is based on how much time you spend together, the frequency of your interactions, and how connected you are, whether it's managed through social media, conversation, or other networks."}, {"conversation_id": "65b33977e123e5924fc37fb7", "question": "Priscille, you\u2019ve articulated how honesty forms the foundation for trust in various relationships, highlighting the importance of understanding and acceptance in strengthening that trust.

Here's a revised version of the text with corrected spelling and improved grammar:\n\n---\n\nYes, so regarding my operational understanding of trust, it involved measuring individuals' perspectives. I attempted to ask open-ended questions such as: \"How do you feel about trust?\" \"What are your thoughts on building trust?\" and \"What does trust mean to you?\" I wanted to gain an understanding and insight into people's pre-existing perceptions of this topic to ensure I comprehended their viewpoints, because much of what trust entails stems from one's beliefs.\n\nFrom there, we could inquire about how they view their relationships and levels of comfort with various people in their lives, such as their parents, friends, romantic partners, neighbors, and coworkers. Since the nature of trust likely varies among these relationships, we aimed to discover if there's consistency in how comfortable people feel with these different individuals, how they resolve conflicts, and how they choose to interact with them.\n\nUnderstanding their perceived level of reliability is also crucial. If we relate to a person, we're more inclined to engage with them based on shared experiences, interests, and goals. All this contributes to the ways we interact with and get to know them further. This approach to validity is rooted in the questions we're asking: How is trust built through interactions, honesty, and frequency of contact?\n\nBy first seeking out individuals' feelings about trust and then delving into aspects like honesty\u2014which involves dealing with conflict and holding grudges\u2014we gather information on the emotional connections people have with others and their comfort in discussing vulnerabilities. The frequency element examines how often they interact, manage conflicts, and reach resolutions with others.\n\nWe gauged reliability by asking participants to rate their feelings on a scale of one to ten. For frequency-based questions, we used a timeframe expressed in weeks or days. This approach ensures that the data can be easily quantified and remains consistent, which is important for replicating the study.\n\nWith this scale, we were able to discern whether there are similarities or differences among people's responses. From these differences, we can draw conclusions; for example, if someone feels more comfortable, identifies as an introvert, or resolves conflicts quickly (within a week), we see that they are likely more inclined to trust readily, without letting past experiences hinder them significantly.\n\nUltimately, this study supports the notion that trust can be developed through frequent contact, honesty, and openness to vulnerability. It helps us arrive at a well-rounded understanding of trust.\n\n---"}, {"conversation_id": "65b33977e123e5924fc37fb7", "question": "You've highlighted the use of both qualitative and quantitative data in exploring trust, which is an insightful way to approach this complex topic.

The quantitative data is more for rating on a scale of one to ten or asking how often something occurs, because we want to see the numbers to understand how comfortable or how frequently people speak with their parents, to determine how those things are consistent, for example. Does that match up with everyone? Then, by asking qualitative questions about how we feel about trust, how trust should be built, and how past hurts in relationships impact trust, we gain insight into where people are coming from\u2014how they have emotions and experiences that they attach to these feelings of trust and how that impacts our perception of trust, as well as what it looks like in our lives.\n\nClearly, asking for those numbers is good, but trust does not manifest in the same way for all of us. Obviously, as an introvert, you might be more inclined to not trust as many people because you don't have a large social circle. As an extrovert, you're likely to be more open and talkative, so trust is probably not as personal of an issue for you, because it might feel natural to you to share anything with anyone, and it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nHaving an understanding of both quantitative and qualitative data gives us the numbers to identify the similarities, while qualitative data reveals the differences. Both can help us come down to a theory or an understanding that trust evolves over time, and how it operates.

Some indicators of attractiveness may include: sexual attraction, heart rate, desire to be around the person, personal preferences of height and weight, and how clean the person seems to be. In order to measure confidence, the prospect will be asked to share what they believe their biggest asset to be, and raters will be asked to rate the prospects projected comfort level while sharing their assets. Some indicators of comfort and confidence include: not fidgeting, degree to stumbling on words, excitement, and vulnerability. This will be measured in a ratio manner, from 0-10. 0 being fidgety and very nervous, 5 being in the middle, neither nervous or confident, and 10 being most confidence possible, and very comfortable in their own skin.

The first raters will be of the same race. The evaluators/raters of the second survey will be diverse with different races. The batch of the same race will be studied first to have similar backgrounds, upbringings, and exposure to social media. The second batch will be diverse in race and religion, but have similar demographics. Again, this allows comparing of social and cultural aspects.

People's differing emotional responses could affect the consistency and reliability of the data.\n\nIn light of this, I decided to adjust my approach and focus on assets rather than insecurities. Assets are usually positive traits or qualities that people feel excited to discuss. The sharing of assets is less likely to be influenced by the emotional distress that might come from discussing insecurities, which means it could provide more objective results for my study. Therefore, I opted to measure confidence by how willingly an individual discusses their assets, as this is a topic people generally enjoy talking about and it is less vulnerable to the kind of manipulation that could jeopardize an experiment."}, {"conversation_id": "65b33cf4e123e5924fcc2651", "question": "Emmelie, your adjustment to measuring confidence by discussing assets rather than insecurities is a thoughtful approach.

Initially, I had opted for either \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" categories. However, I later decided that a ratio-based approach would be better, mainly because the concepts of \"favorable\" and \"unfavorable\" are very black and white, and I don't believe you can fit someone's values neatly into one of those two categories. Values vary, and it's not always a clear-cut case of either completely hating or absolutely aligning with someone else's values.\n\nI think there needs to be some degree of variance and the opportunity to rate on a scale of zero to ten to indicate how much you resonate with those values and how well you believe they align with what is socially acceptable. Therefore, I chose to implement the ratio rating system, ranging from zero to ten, with zero being the least favorable, five indicating no opinion, and ten being the most favorable.\n\nA significant reason for this decision was that a \"no opinion\" option was missing from the original dichotomous choice. Thus, the point five provides that middle ground for when a person's values don't particularly resonate with you, yet they don't seem unsuitable either. The scale also includes everything in between, which allows room for respondents to customize their answers more precisely."}, {"conversation_id": "65b33cf4e123e5924fcc2651", "question": "You've given some solid reasons for choosing a ratio scale over a categorical one, Emmelie, highlighting the need for nuance in assessing values.

That's why I decided to conduct these two experiments. The first one involved raters all of the same race, and the second involved a mix with five different races, with two representatives each. I was certain that these biases would have a significant effect, especially with various races and demographics coming into play. Therefore, I conducted both experiments to study this phenomenon.\n\nI am not suggesting that the study will conclude with these two experiments. However, I believe that by carrying out and comparing the results of both, I will be able to analyze these potential biases more effectively. This is the whole goal of operationalization. After conducting this research, I expect to better understand these biases, and possibly to plan another experiment where we have a more refined grasp of potential biases. This could allow us to manipulate these factors more precisely.\n\nCertainly, what is socially acceptable can often boil down to personal opinion. Generally speaking, social acceptability varies, but everyone has their own perception of it. That's why I organized two different experiments\u2014to see how demographics, races, and cultures play into perceptions of social acceptability. It was something I wanted to explore in this experiment. I am very aware that there may be potential biases and, after analyzing them further, I might conduct a subsequent experiment to investigate those particular biases that could be relevant to both of the initial experiments."}, {"conversation_id": "65b33cf4e123e5924fcc2651", "question": "Emmelie, it's impressive how you've considered the impact of demographics on social acceptability.

Here is the text with improved spelling and grammar:\n\nYes, so I believe that in relation to validity, this is obviously more closely linked to accuracy. I think what mostly pertains to this discussion is face validity, which is a judgement on the surface, based on common understanding, as well as criterion validity, which refers to a measurement that logically relates to another variable outside of the study.\n\nBasically, I'm talking about how values are considered favorable or unfavorable by an individual, and how these favorability values can indicate how closely a person aligns with their own values and whether they perceive those values to be socially acceptable. This is definitely related to criterion validity, as it pertains to another variable outside of the study. Whether a person finds someone else's values favorable or not may, as I mentioned in the previous question, have to do with biases originating from their own culture, upbringing, and other factors like that.\n\nI believe that I've attempted to make this aspect more valid by conducting two experiments so I could compare the results. In the first experiment, we have individuals of the same race assessing each other, and in the second one, we have individuals of a different race doing the assessments.\n\nMoving on to reliability\u2014reliability is the degree to which the same measurement procedures will yield consistent results if conducted multiple times, emphasizing consistency, precision, and stability. I am conducting this experiment twice, so I hope to observe similar results. While the experiment is not conducted in precisely the same manner each time, as we do introduce a variable by changing the people who are rating the subjects, I have clearly stated in my operational definition exactly how I intend to run this experiment, including the procedures. So, if anyone were to replicate this study, they would hopefully obtain similar results.\n\nShould I consider making changes, I would be more specific in my selection of participants. Instead of randomly selecting individuals, I would opt for a more structured approach. For the first round, we might choose ten people from the same race, and for the second round, we could possibly select two from the same race and culture, and so on, thus aiming to enhance the reliability of the results.\n\nThis way, if someone else were to conduct my study, they would be more likely to attain the same results."}, {"conversation_id": "65b33cf4e123e5924fcc2651", "question": "You've outlined a thoughtful approach to validating your survey through repeated trials and varied participant demographics.

I understand that what is socially acceptable, as well as social norms, are influenced by one's upbringing, cultural background, religious beliefs, or the absence thereof, and even by the geographic location where one resides. To elaborate further on how altering these backgrounds might influence the outcomes, consider the following: \n\nFor instance, in the first round, if I were to select participants who are all White, there appears to be a common trend, as indicated by many studies, where individuals choose a significant other based on a resemblance to themselves. Consequently, I would anticipate that the raters might score individuals who look more like themselves higher on a scale of physical attractiveness. It is important to note that I am not in agreement with this bias; rather, it's just a hypothesis based on scientific literature. This could potentially give those who are White or have lighter skin tones an advantage.\n\nHowever, by later altering the racial backgrounds of participants, we introduce a more controlled variable. Instead of having all participants who look the same and who might traditionally be inclined to choose partners resembling themselves, we now have a diverse group. This diversity could lead to a greater variance in preferences, which, in my opinion, might result in more valid findings in the end."}, {"conversation_id": "65b33cf4e123e5924fcc2651", "question": "You've given a solid rationale for predicting that raters may assess people who resemble themselves more favorably.

From my experience with AI, I understand that it's a computer system and not a human, so it doesn't think the way a human does, which could potentially negatively impact the quality. It doesn't think like a human and does have its limitations. However, for me personally, during this experiment, I actually found it to be super helpful. I was able to take the recommendations it provided, determine whether I agreed or disagreed with them, and then implement them if I decided to.\n\nI think it offered some great points and significantly developed my thinking. I went from creating an original definition to consulting with the AI, seeing what results that would yield, and then revising my initial definition. Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that I started with a blank slate, created something original, then received feedback, reflected on it, and worked on something that was no longer as original since it had been reviewed by another entity, so to speak. I believe this process truly enhanced the quality of my submission.\n\nRegarding the reliability of my survey data, the use of AI also increased it. Initially, I had different types of measuring variables: ratio, a range from zero to ten, favorability rates from 'favorable' to 'unfavorable', which included categorical, nominal, and ordinal data. However, after consulting with the chatbot, I decided to consolidate everything into ratio data. The AI also advised me to define my concepts more clearly, ensuring that there would be no room for misinterpretation in case someone wanted to recreate the study. If there's no misinterpretation and a person conducts the experiment exactly the way I did, that naturally increases reliability. So, in this case, I do believe that the AI increased both the quality and reliability of my survey data.

It has the dimensions of harmony, admiration and calm. Harmony means when things fit well together or blend. This is an especially complex and vague dimension because when we think of harmony, it often brings to mind music, but also colors, textures, shapes, plant life. If different aspects of a whole thing that we consider as beautiful have balance, it contributes to the appeal. This dimension is also more objective, as we all have similar perceptions of it. Admiration means to look up to and appreciate. This is different for everybody and especially subjective, as we all appreciate different things and have our own individual perspectives about beauty. Calm means a state of peace or being mellow. Something beautiful has that effect because it seems like a human instinct. \n- Beauty can include fashion/style, physical traits, cosmetics, nature, art, writing and music. Some examples are hairstyles (fits with admiration), sunsets (calm) or foggy rain, and orchestral or classical pieces (harmony). This proves how all sorts of things in life can possess beauty and are easily and naturally appreciable. There are also beauty standards that change over the years and can even cycle in and out repeatedly. These are unique to different and diverse cultures and peoples, regions, age groups and gender. People with varying demographic information can also have varying corresponding beauty standards and personal definitions of beauty. Also, university students these days are most likely to have fixed views of beauty and to be influenced by beauty standards due to the social media age. They are also likely to have similar views on beauty as the rest of their age group/generation. Beauty standards are constantly shifting and are very influential, and come have roots that go far back in history, so they have a rich context. They can have both a positive and negative effect on us, for example, for negative effects we can think of \"trends\" that involve physical build or harmful alterations, and for positive effects there is the case of self-expression in unique fashion styles and subcultures. An example of this is my favorite fashion aesthetic: cottagecore. It saw a boost in popularity in 2020 and I think it is beautiful because it has whimsy and a cute vibe, involves nature, and uses calm colors with very feminine outfits.\n- True, there are the dimensions of beauty to keep in mind, but it is worth mentioning that even subjectively imperfect or flawed things can have it. This is because imperfections can sometimes add a bit of edge or contrast to something that would otherwise be artificial or uncanny feeling. This brings in the idea of emotion in beauty. Both positively and negatively emotive things can have beauty, just in their own way. Sometimes a beautiful thing can give us complex emotions that are impossible to describe. They can be positive or negative, or both. Even negative emotions can feel somewhat positive, even deceivingly so in this context, because they can complement positive ones and emphasize them. This is a common experience with music, for example. It is an instinctive experience to be affected by various types of music and it is easy to appreciate its beauty.\n\nOperational:\nI can operationalize beauty by conducting a survey for UW students (initially doing a practice test with a small group of 10 from one of my courses, who will tell me if they approve of the wording and clarity). It will give them a questionnaire asking:\nWhat year are you (in university)?\nThey will answer 1, 2, 3, 4, or >4.\nWhat is your gender?\nThey will answer male, female, other (fill in the blank), or prefer not to say.\nWhat is your cultural background/ethnicity?\nThey will circle Caucasian, African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, Native American, mixed/multiple, other (fill in the blank), or prefer not to say.\nDo you see yourself as a person who is especially perceptive or appreciative of beauty?\nThey will answer no, slightly, neutral, probably, or yes.\nHow big of a priority for you is it to maintain a beautiful appearance?\nThey will answer none, somewhat, or high.\nDo you feel that beauty standards have made a significant impact or influenced you personal views on beauty? You can think of this as local American or Western beauty standards or beauty standards from any culture or region. Some examples are physical attributes, fashion, cosmetics, etc.\nThey will answer yes, unsure, or no.\nIf your answer was yes, how has this impacted your self-esteem/confidence?\nThey will answer negatively, neutral, or positively. \nFinally, tell us a few sentences about how your personal definition of beauty has changed over the years, and if you can think of specific reasons or examples, explain why:\n They will write a short chunk of text. \nDimensional references-\nWhich idea do you feel is most indicative of beauty?\nharmony\nadmiration\ncalm\nnone of the above\nall of the above\nThey will circle an option.\n\nAll your responses and personal identifiers will be kept confidential and anonymous.\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706248793259, "student": {"_id": "6598589bf619d8d44c5df921", "uid": "jmQufzfqQvY8v3NbQRQ05zgXAf82", "email": "vmirea@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704482971382, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Victoria Mirea", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Beauty is a noun often used to describe things that are subjectively pleasing to the eye based on physical characteristics and internal qualities. There is not one universal definition of beauty, because not only is it subjective, but many social and cultural factors can influence the way beauty is perceived. Beauty looks very different all around the world. Skin color, height, stature, etc. are all subject to different beauty standards in different cultures. Furthermore, beauty is also not stagnant, as beauty standards are constantly evolving to make room for new trends, ideas, and innovations. This also means that it is not defined simply by physical attributes, but on a broader basis that encompasses personality traits such as maturity or kindness. Inner beauty explores more desirable qualities that the eye cannot see, representing how beauty is not only subjective but also not purely physical. Inner beauty often trumps outer beauty as personality is very integral to the persona of a person.\n\nThese traits are also subjective, representing how standards of beauty are not universally agreed upon. For example, art is an example of how we perceive beauty. Artwork is very subjective, and those with a unique understanding of it may find a simplistic, abstract painting beautiful to look at while those with less experience with art may feel it is too simplistic to be considered beautiful. Additionally, another example that deals with inner beauty is how different personality traits are interpreted by different people. If someone is very outgoing and loud, they might find someone more reserved and quiet to be more appealing. Conversely, someone shy and insecure may find someone who is loud and confident and very beautiful.\u00a0\n\nAttractiveness describes looking physically satisfying to others, often by features or personality characteristics. Personality characteristics are traits that express a person's real identity and persona. Quality is the standard of most things, an example of superiority. Superiority describes the state of being better than what it is compared to. This contributes to our perception of beauty because it acts as the degree of excellence, providing insight into superiority and measuring things against each other. This happens in beauty too, as the standard of beauty is supposed to include the most superior traits and attributes.\u00a0\n\nThese concepts exist on a scale that is usually connected to beauty as well. Highly attractive things are also considered beautiful because they are both describing something highly pleasing, however, like beauty, attractiveness does not represent universal beauty. Something that is of high quality or superiority is also considered beautiful because it exceeds standards because of its attributes. This doesn't mean it is universally perceived as beautiful, but once again, these traits are subjective and often have a strong correlation with beauty.\n\nIn my own experience, beauty is an ever-changing concept. Throughout my childhood, my ideas of what beauty looked like revolved around my current interests like sports, makeup, and my friends. Now that I am older and more exposed to the factors around me, I am more likely to be susceptible to online beauty standards and the factors that surround me daily. For example, I no longer think skinny jeans and sparkly shirts are beautiful, instead, I like a more toned-down outfit that compliments my skin and hair color. The things I find beautiful today are likely to change, but that doesn't mean they are any less beautiful, just that my values and tastes have evolved. These changes are most likely influenced by societal expectations and even social media. It is very easy to be swayed by the opinions of others, and the same can be said for beauty. If we are constantly exposed to content that emphasizes beauty, we too will start to believe it to be beautiful.\u00a0\n\nThe conceptualization of beauty is a complex topic that includes many different facets and multiple dimensions. The overarching theme that appears when researching this concept is that beauty is not only physical but emotional, and that the meaning of beauty is fluid, consistently changing, and holding different meanings across the world and through many cultures. The main dimensions of beauty, - attractiveness and quality - help emphasize Beauty standards and the measurement of pleasing attributes. When looking at beauty broadly, we will see that many things are beautiful, it is \"all in the eye of the beholder\" as the saying goes. Though complex, beauty should be understood as something subjectively pleasant. If this concept is then applied to a study, it would be best to identify the differences in beauty standards of different individuals from many backgrounds. This could be done by providing examples of common \"beautiful\" things as having people rank them on a scale based on their own ideas of beauty.\u00a0\n\nOperationalization:\u00a0\n\nThe study will focus on tracking the idea of teenage beauty standards as they differ in multiple countries across the world. The study will be made up of teenagers (ages 13-19) from multiple countries from each continent (excluding Antarctica) who will be shown a series of photos on a range of topics including art, fashion, facial structure, body type, hair color, skin tone, etc. The participant selection will be based on a volunteer basis, but a priority will go to diverse candidates that come from a variety of socio-economic classes, ethnicities, geographical areas, and education levels. If needed, extrinsic motivators like monetary compensation will be provided to participants if participation is low. To combat potential issues with participants, conduct a pilot test with fewer individuals from around the world to see if there are any clear issues with wording, structure, or understanding in the survey.\n\nThese photos are the variables in the study, and will therefore be characterized by the teens to gain their feedback on what they deem is the most beautiful in each category. To do this, they will be given a survey in which they must rank the photos on beauty using categorical variables from 1-10 (1 being the least beautiful, 10 being the most beautiful). This ordinal range of variables is the indicators. The numbers will be used to represent beauty and identify the results.\n\nOnce the surveys are complete, observers will look for any particular trends to decipher the results. If the results show an insufficient amount of evidence or patterning, the study will be altered and redone. This study will predominantly be focused on outer beauty because the medium in which the study utilizes (photos) is purely physical. In a perfect situation, inner beauty would also be studied, including emotional attributes, but the physical nature of the survey provides its own challenges in including all types of beauty, so a study on inner beauty would need to be separated into a new study.\n\nThis study however may still be limited by different biases including cultural, social desirability, and interpretation. Some of these biases may help researchers understand the perceptions of beauty in different parts of the world, but others may limit results and should be accounted for before the survey is administered. This study is also limited in time, as beauty standards in nature are always evolving, which means the findings of this study may be useless years from now. That is why this study should be replicated often to account for changing interpretations of beauty. Further, to account for observation bias observers will not be given any information on the participants, and will instead focus purely on the results from each survey. We will also utilize inter-rater reliability by having different observers assess the same behavior.\n\nThe study also must consider ethical considerations, including providing consent by all participants and keeping the personal information of each participant private. Additionally, it will be crucial to provide a detailed preview of what the study will look like before participants sign consent so that they are prepared for the study.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706248710371, "student": {"_id": "65986b76f619d8d44c5df93f", "uid": "5AlxvqEyb2NSuE5BU0zU0lIEmfw1", "email": "kgodby@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704487798680, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Katherine Godby", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Love is a state that someone can be in, feeling it towards someone or something, and can be shown in many different ways all over the world depending on the cultural background and also religious beliefs. Loyalty is a trait where the person or thing you love will always stay true to you no matter what. Trust is something that is not easily earned and is fragile. It is the concept that you give someone without a doubt they will always do right by you, and you can confide in them always because they will not lie to you. However, there are often challenges and imperfections that come along with these two dimensions of love. Love is not always perfect; it needs challenges and conflicts to make it even stronger. Loyalty and trust wouldn't mean as much if everyone gave and received them equally. Joy and affection are feelings you experience towards a person or thing that makes you feel good inside and out. The affection you feel can put a smile on your face or make you laugh. Emotion is the dimension that is most felt when feeling love, I believe. When feeling love, reciprocity is one thing you hope the other person or thing will understand. You want to receive love and emotion back, not just give it. Receiving it back makes giving it all worth it. But if the person that you love doesn't love you back, you can be overcome with emotions like sadness, anger, and regret. In order to love, you have to be vulnerable to the thing you love. You have to open yourself up to them, letting them in where most people would never be let in. This makes love fragile in certain circumstances because you might be afraid to get hurt. But if you want to feel love fully, you have to be willing to risk everything. Variation of love is looking at all the different ways that you could feel love for someone or something. You have familial love, partner love, pet love, and even friendship love, each one having its own characteristics and each one giving you all the dimensions of love in a different way. One dimension of love that can be seen as the most important is self-love. Self-love is being able to apply all the dimensions of love within ourselves, not just towards others, because it starts from within. You have to be able to love yourself before you try to love someone else.\nOperational: For my measurement: in a survey, I will ask, based on feedback\n\nfirstly Demographic: Age, race, gender\n\nHave you ever been in love before: yes or no  \n\nLoyalty: In an argument in your relationships how would you say your actions are during a challenging time? 1: supportive, 2: somewhat supportive, 3: don't know, 4: somewhat unsupportive, 5: unsupportive \n\nTrust: When looking at trust in your relationships, how trustworthy are you? 1: trustworthy, 2: somewhat trustworthy, 3: don't know, 4: somewhat untrustworthy, 5: untrustworthy \n\nAffection: How affectionate are you towards in your relationships: 1: very affectionate, 2: somewhat affectionate, 3: neutral, 4: somewhat unaffectionate, 5: unaffectionate \n\nJoy: How happy are you in your relationships: 1: very happy, 2: Happy, 3: don't know/neutral, 4: somewhat unhappy, 5: unhappy \n\nEmotion: How would you rate the reciprocity of your emotion in your relationships: 1: always reciprocated, 2: somewhat reciprocated, 3: don't know, 4: rarely reciprocated, 5: never reciprocated\n\nI will conduct a survey using these questions, I will also instead of testing a broad range of people I would first do pilot testing with a small range of people more specifically a group of college students in order to see how peers think, to make sure the questions are clear and not confusing in any way. The researcher can then observe the operationalization by using the responses and turning them into values in order to make them easier to understand, therefore allowing for even easier ways to analyze the data based on the questions being asked in the survey. In doing this I will also have to make sure that the conversion to numerical values makes sense and follows a pattern in order to avoid confusion, for example using similar words in all the questions instead of changing them in between every question in order to make everything in converting them as smooth as possible. Lastly, I will overlook the survey before and after in order to see if any ethical dilemmas and to also make sure the survey follows ethical guidelines.

It's hard to turn away from the loyalty expected in these familial bonds. However, loyalty without trust can impact the relationship by making it more one-sided, especially from the perspective of the person whose trust was breached.

This hypothetical ethical situation will need to be clear and not overly complex so that participants can respond accurately and timely. I will choose a diverse group of participants so that I have a wide range of observations. The intervals will be from 1 to 5, with an answer on each that can be chosen based on the question asked in the ethical situation.

Undeniable means no one can argue that it is false. Falsifiability means the truth can be proven false at any point in time. Though falsifiability is key when proving if a scientific theory is accurate or truthful, in the context of philosophical or ethical truths, falsifiability is not always applicable. Truth can be in the form of either a statement which is also known as an argument, a fact which is also known as a proof, or a philosophical concept which uses logic to arrive at a conclusion. If all conclusive evidence aligns in a factual way within either a statement, fact or concept, then it can be considered a truth. All conclusions are dynamic which means they are moldable and can change over time as new evidence and perspectives emerge.  Evidence standards are different for each circumstance regarding truth. In scientific contexts, strong empirical evidence may be required while in philosophical discussions, truth may be established through logical reasoning without material evidence to back it up. Truth is subjective which means that not everyone can interpret subjects the same so what is truthful to one person might not be to the next person. Ultimately truth is complex and context-dependent which may have varying criteria for what constitutes truth based on the different aspects of diverse humans.  There is no universal truth.\n\nFinal operational definition: \n\u2022 All the following surveys will be done under a truth detector to make sure people are not lying. The researcher will first obtain informed consent and explain that the data is classified but not anonymous. The original researcher must pilot test their specific questions with a smaller group to improve the overall quality of the data and make it replicable for future researchers.\nSubjectivity- In a survey, I ask participants in the same room to rate how cold it feels outside on a scale from 1 (hot) to 10 (freezing). One person could say it is cold outside while another could say it is warm. This is a subjective truth because they both are telling the truth, they just have their definition of warm and cold. (both participants, even though they may have different answers, are expressing their subjective truths based on their own perceptions of the temperature.)\nContext Dependant- I would ask participants (all from diverse upbringings) \"What is god?\" in a categorically exhaustive survey. I will also ask them questions about their upbringing and religion. These are as follows: What country are you from? What religion do you identify with? Would you identify as a religious person?\nDynamic-  I will ask the same participants ten years later what god is in a categorically exhaustive survey to see if their answers changed.  This is the test-retest method. Potential factors or life events might change the participants' perspectives on the concept of God over the ten-year period. Personal growth, exposure to new ideas, new habits, or shifts in their religious or philosophical beliefs could all impact a participant's answer to this question. \n\n\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706249615016, "student": {"_id": "6597808cf619d8d44c5df8d9", "uid": "4npfjLkktOckS12ayqw0e2mcvjq1", "email": "mblatt@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704427660682, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Marina Blatt", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Frightening is conceptualized as creating a feeling that harm may result, which triggers an avoidant response. Dangerous is conceptualized as carrying the potential or likelihood of causing harm. Harm is conceptualized as any negative physical, social, and/or emotional effect. Intimidating is a task quality conceptualized as a one which makes individuals hesitant or unwilling to perform a task due to perceived difficulty, fear, uncertainty, emotional discomfort, or social repercussions.\n\nCourage is operationalized as follows: The indicator for \"willingness to act\" will be operationalized as the subject walking through a commercial \"haunted house\" attraction with at least 5 \"rooms\" or separate segments. The subject's \"willingness to act\" data point will be counted both by the number of rooms they complete before deciding to leave, and their subjective fear as recorded on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest, before and after each individual room. Their stress levels will also be gauged with heartbeat monitors. There will be cameras set up in each room of the attraction. Participants will wear a heart beat monitor to determine their heart rate throughout the study. If and when a participant leaves the room to exit the house, it will be recorded. Before going through the house, subjects will be told that they are testing how much being asked to consider their fear levels while in a simulated \u201cscary\u201d environment affects their heart rate. They will be told that if they are too scared before entering any of the actual rooms of the attraction, that this is entirely okay as there is still heartbeat data collected. They will also be asked to only go through each room once, in the sequential order they're set up. If they ignore this instruction any data collected during repeat rooms will be ignored. Potential subjects will also be screened for experience with \u201chaunted house\u201d attractions - individuals who report regularly visiting these attractions and not having ever being scared by them will not be selected as participants. \n\u00a0\nParticipants will be scored as follows: if they declined to enter a single room, their score is zero. For each room attempted, they will get points equal to the level of fear recorded before entering the room or after completing the last room. Their fright level will only be recorded once between rooms - the same score for after they've completed room 1 as when they're about to enter room 2. For each room completed, they will get points equal to the level of fear that they report after finishing the room multiplied by 2. They will also have the number of rooms completed multiplied by 2 added to their score. So if a participant reports a level of 1 before entering the first room, a level of 3 after finishing it, and then enters the second room but leaves halfway through or even immediately, their score will be 11. Thus, if two participants complete all rooms but one was more scared than the other throughout, they will be operationalized as having a higher level of courage.\n\u00a0\nHeart rate will contribute to a different set of data points. Each heartbeat rate increase will be measured and graphed, with their baseline bpm measured prior to the study. Participants who experience increased bpm during a room but complete it anyway will get 1 point per 5bpm levels above baseline per room.\u00a0So if a participant\u2019s bpm rises 10 bpm during the first room and then stays at that level during the entire study, they will get 2 points per room completed. \n\u00a0\nRoom completion, heart rate data, and fear ratings will both be recorded as separate data points for each participant. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs my definition of \"courage\" does not require the situation to be frightening and dangerous and intimidating (and it would be unethical to put a subject in danger of being harmed), I will create a situation that is merely agreed upon before the study as frightening.\u00a0\"Frightening\" will be operationalized by having four panels of 5 people each visit a variety of commercial haunted houses prior the study and rate the amount of subjective fright that each room in each attraction causes on an interval scale of 1-5. An attraction with an average rating of 3.5 or above by three of the four panels is defined as \"frightening\" and, assuming that at least one attraction sampled is defined as \"frightening\", the highest scoring attraction will be used for the study. If no attractions meet the criteria, the panels will sample further \"haunted house\" attractions until they find one that is defined as \"frightening\". So, \"courage\" is operationalized as the amount of rooms or segments of a \"haunted house\" attraction a subject is willing to walk through, when that \"haunted house\" attraction is rated by the panels as \"frightening\".\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFollowing the experiment, participants will be debriefed on what the study was actually about, what the goals were, and what their scores were. Participants will be invited to share feedback, encouraged to share any moral, ethical, or procedural issues they had with the study, and offered a warm drink to calm down.

Throughout the study, I asked the participants whether they felt scared and to detail their levels of fright. However, I wanted to confirm that the experience was widely recognized as frightening before involving the participants because I did not want to place them in a situation that might not elicit fear. Without induced fear, I would not be able to collect reliable data.\n\nInitially, I considered sending twenty people to a haunted house. Later, I questioned whether changing the structure to four panels of five people would significantly impact the study. My concern was that if all participants went through the haunted house together, they could potentially influence one another's reactions. If all twenty people were together in one room, it might not be feasible, and issues could arise.\n\nTherefore, I revised the setup to four panels of five participants, maintaining the same headcount but dividing it into smaller groups. This change meant that if a few resilient individuals who managed to pass the screening process were present and did not get easily frightened, they would likely only influence a maximum of four other people. Similarly, if there was any participant who was genuinely terrified, their fear could heighten the atmosphere for a maximum of four others.\n\nConcerning the aspect of fear, I may have included more dimensions, but it seemed that the primary measure was the feeling of fright. I believed that simply asking participants how scared they were could provide a reasonable assessment of their fear. Of course, some people may feign bravery in studies like this, but if someone is unable to progress through the rooms, it still reflects on their level of scare, despite what they report. This is why, apart from self-reported fear levels, I also measured the number of rooms completed as an objective metric.\n\nThe concept of 'frightening' in this context was defined as the creation of a perception that harm might occur, which would trigger an avoidance response. 'Harm' was broadly interpreted as any negative experience. Even though the threats in a haunted house are not genuine, the fear that an actor might jump out can still invoke a sense of dread, aligning with the definition of fear used for this study.\n\nThe other aspect of the 'frightening' definition involves triggering an avoidance response, which is what I aimed to measure. Are participants choosing to exit the haunted house prematurely or skip rooms? If they do, it indicates that an avoidance response has been activated due to fear. I feel that their decision to leave supports the operational definition of 'frightening'\u2014if they exit, it confirms that they experienced an avoidance response driven by fear."}, {"conversation_id": "65b34d5de123e5924fe910ec", "question": "It's interesting how you've considered the potential influence of group dynamics on the perception of fear.

But if you're asking how to ensure that the results are accurate, well, you can never be one hundred percent sure. However, they know their role is to test the scare factor. These are people who have signed up not just to be tested but because they understand the importance of providing data that will be used to carry out tests on others. So, I think it's safe to assume that panel members are motivated to be truthful about their feelings. \n\nOf course, they could still be influenced. But I mean, it's not straightforward. When I'm really scared, say I'm watching a scary movie, and there's someone next to me who isn't scared at all, it doesn't make me less scared. Perhaps it'll affect my immersion a little if they make comments throughout, but it won't completely ruin the scariness for me. And if I'm not scared at all and I'm watching with someone who is very easily frightened, it doesn't make the movie more terrifying for me, generally speaking. Sometimes, I might see it a little through their eyes, but personally, I don't think this is likely to heavily impact the data. That's why I made the decision to have a smaller panel \u2013 to mitigate the chances of outliers significantly changing the experience just for a few others and not the entire group.\n\nAs to how I plan to ensure that the fright levels reported reflect their true feelings and aren't influenced by others in the panel, I plan to do that by selecting people who are unlikely to be unfaithful in their responses and who are motivated to create what they believe is an accurate assessment of the haunted house's fright level. I could also consider having the panel members go through the haunted house and collect heart rate data. But again, if they're influenced by the reactions of those around them, they're still experiencing fear. It's common to go through a haunted house with other people, and this does affect the experience a little, so you're always going to have others around. It doesn't mean that the data isn't valid. I believe that if someone is scared, they're going to be scared, and if they're not, they're not.

I chose to use a group-based approach rather than relying on a single individual's assessment of whether a haunted house is scary, or simply sending participants to a random attraction that may not be genuinely fear-inducing. This is especially important for subjective notions like fear. When dealing with latent constructs such as \"frightening,\" it is advisable to gather a wide range of opinions.\n\nI selected a threshold of more than 3.5 because it seemed appropriate. A rating of merely 1 or 2 would not signify a scary experience, but setting the bar at 4 could exclude too many candidates and result in an impractical search for increasingly scarier haunted houses. A score of 3 on a 5-point scale didn't seem to convey enough intensity\u2014it's somewhat scary but not excessively so. Therefore, I felt that 3.5 was a satisfactory compromise, high enough for the average person to feel fear, acknowledging that they're scared without being completely terrified, yet not so high that it necessitates an extensive search for more haunted houses.\n\nMoreover, by using a panel and involving multiple individuals, we aim to ensure a more reliable operationalization of \"frightening.\" I believe this approach corresponds well to the conceptual definition of frightening that I've proposed, as it provokes an avoidant response based on the perception that something negative could occur. Although the encounter may not result in substantial harm, the mere act of being startled by a sudden appearance can still qualify as a form of harm within the context of a negative emotional impact. While being scared can be entertaining, the sensation itself is fundamentally averse.\n\nIn my study protocol, when an actor jumps out, it is expected to induce fear and potentially an avoidant reaction. We are assessing whether participants have an emotional reaction and report feeling scared. These measures are sound methods for determining if the experience is indeed frightening."}, {"conversation_id": "65b34d5de123e5924fe910ec", "question": "You've put thought into selecting a threshold that's neither too high nor too low for the fright level, balancing efficiency with the need for a genuinely scary experience.

Such intensely frightening scenarios are exceedingly uncommon. While one might be tempted to test for courage in these extreme circumstances, I believe it's not only challenging but also ethically questionable to create a study that would place participants in situations that cause them genuine, profound fear.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean the data isn't generalizable. There are individuals who we would describe as courageous, and as I mentioned earlier, they haven't necessarily faced many full-blown, terrifying situations. Rather, they find themselves in scenarios that are moderately intimidating\u2014a three or four out of five in terms of fear or danger\u2014and yet they're willing to take action. For example, they might stand up for what's right even when their friends disagree or confront their partner over a contentious issue. Such confrontations can be incredibly intimidating, especially when you care deeply about the other person and you both hold strong, opposing views on the matter.\n\nSetting the standard at a three out of five doesn't equate to the fear one might experience in a haunted house, but it's important to realize that most situations requiring bravery aren't about facing the utmost fear or danger. They're often more average, middle-of-the-road challenges that one encounters regularly\u2014the kind of scenarios that are normal in both a mathematical sense and in the non-mathematical sense of being something we generally consider as typical.\n\nIn my opinion, this might make the data more generalizable. If you were to test people in five out of five fear scenarios to assess their courage, you would be examining the highest levels and types of courage, rather than a more common form of bravery. This wouldn't necessarily make the findings non-generalizable, but what I've proposed here is more applicable to the everyday kind of courage that people are more likely to need."}, {"conversation_id": "65b34d5de123e5924fe910ec", "question": "It's interesting how you've associated the concept of courage with everyday scenarios rather than extreme conditions.

They might say, \"Hey, I don't think this is accurate.\" Sometimes, having your self-belief affirmed can be just as potent as having someone tell you something that isn't true about you. You sometimes don't realize how strongly you believe something until someone states the opposite, and you think about it and say, \"No, that's wrong. I am brave, and this study didn't measure it very well.\"\n\nSo, I could imagine that post-study feedback's effect would depend on how well the study was designed. I would like to think that it was designed well, but I did it over the course of like two hours for a college class. I'm not a professional researcher; I'm not perfect. If the study was really well-designed, then whether a chatbot or a human is collecting feedback, people might have positive reflections about themselves and their perceptions of courage by discussing everything with the chatbot. \n\nAs for why the chatbot was mentioned, I'm not sure\u2014I personally don't think talking to chatbots could ever be important in any situation. If the study is poorly designed, then people might feel more confident about their beliefs or identify what was wrong with the operational definition of courage.\n\nI know this is supposed to be the last question, but if you could clarify what you meant, I would appreciate it, and I'd be willing to answer another question because I am a bit curious. But I feel like I have given the best answer I could. So, if that's the conclusion, then that's the end."}]}, "65b36e8ce123e5924f224405": {"_id": "65b36e8ce123e5924f224405", "created_at": 1706258060361, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "Final conceptualization: An emotion is a multifaceted concept with the dimensions of behavior, and cognitive. An emotion involves how we behave, feel, and in response to ongoing experiences and moments. Behavior is influenced by one's feelings based on the situation, and feelings are shaped by behavioral responses. Cognitive is the emotional state based on the interpretation of the situation. \n\nFinal operationalization: I would conduct a survey asking high school students what their emotions are whenever they are at school. I believe this is important because by the time these students get to high school, they are going to deal with more challenges such as getting more homework, or balancing out school with work, sports, and life in general. Because of that, they are going to feel some sort of emotion. Then, I will ask some follow up questions such as how does their emotion affect their behavior because these emotions can play a role in how they act, and what about school makes them feel this type of emotion.

The cause of this social Isolation can be both self-inflicted or the cause of an outside factor. For example, an individual can be isolated because they have low self-esteem, which causes them to not want to go out and make meaningful connections, or they could be isolated because of a language barrier, which makes it difficult to establish relationships.\u00a0\n\n2) Lack of Autonomy: Alienation can manifest itself in a sense of powerlessness for the individual experiencing it. They may feel like they are unable to make the choices they want to make. Lack of autonomy can be caused by various factors such as societal pressure, peer pressure, and even economic factors.\u00a0\n\n3) Sense of Community: Alienation can also manifest itself in a feeling that an individual is not part of any cohesive group. In many cases, an individual who feels a lack of belonging to a social group will feel increased levels of alienation. Not being able to groups can stem from an individual not identifying with the ideals and values of the group. Again this could be due to societal factors and expectations.\n\n4) Estrangement from work or activities:\u00a0 People experiencing alienation may also feel disconnected from their professional life and their passions. This dimension accounts for the fact that alienation can extend beyond just social relationships. Alienation can cause individuals to feel like their work and passions are no longer worth pursuing\u00a0\n\n5) Cultural alienation: This final dimension of alienation refers to an individual's disconnection from the norms and values of the society they live in. People may feel like the society they live in does not prioritize the values that align with their personal beliefs, and may feel alienated as a result. To expand on this, it is important to realize that cultural alienation can stem from other factors like ethnicity, socioeconomic background, and religion, rather than just societal values.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOperationalization\n\n1) Social Isolation\n\n(In all cases, 1 is the lowest option, and 5 is the highest option)\n\nOn a scale of 1-5, how frequently do you interact with others outside of work\u00a0\nRate your agreement with this statement on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being never and 5 being very frequently \"I often feel lonely/isolated\"\n\n2) Autonomy\n\nOn a scale of 1-5, rate your ability to make decisions that align with your personal desires and values\u00a0\nPost-survey interview question -> Please discuss the reasons for which you feel you have low autonomy (open-ended)\u00a0\n\n3) Sense of Community\n\nHow many times a week do you interact with groups and communities: 0 times, 1-3 times,\u00a0 4-6 times, 7-9 times, 10+ times, ultimately, these would be translated into a 1-5 scale\u00a0\nOn a scale of 1-5, how included do you feel in the groups you interact with\u00a0\nOn a scale of 1-5, do you feel that your values and the values of the groups you engage with align?\n\n4) Estrangement From work/Activities\u00a0\n\nThe three following questions would appear in random order to minimize response bias\n\non a scale of 1-5 rate your engagement with professional life and career advancement\u00a0\nrate your agreement to the following statement from 1-5 \"I feel fulfilled in my career\"\nrate your agreement to the following statement from 1-5 \"I feel value in pursuing interests and passions outside of my career\"\nPost survey question: Why do you not feel that career/personal goals are worth pursuing?\n\n5) Cultural Alienation\n\non a scale of 1-5, rate your alignment between personal beliefs and values/ideals of society, with 5 being very aligned, and 1 being not aligned at all.\npost-survey interview question: what factors (eg. racial, religious, socio-economic) influence the lack of alignment between your personal beliefs and those of society\u00a0\n\nFocus group and Post interview Survey\u00a0\n\nAsk the participants to speak about any relevant experiences that shaped their answers.

My understanding was that when people feel alienated, they often sense that they lack the means or the ability to make choices they desire. Consequently, they are not able to make choices that align with their values and what they truly want to do.\n\nIn developing my conceptual definition for this dimension, I aimed to show that a lack of autonomy could be an indicator of alienation because people might feel that their choices have no meaning in the broader context of their lives. When developing this dimension, I tried to identify potential causes of a lack of autonomy, which can stem from various factors. It's not solely due to social factors; economic factors can also play a significant role. For instance, someone might feel a lack of autonomy because they don't have enough financial resources to pursue their interests. Similarly, societal pressures can lead to a lack of autonomy by compelling individuals to conform to unwelcome norms, making them feel unable to engage in the activities they wish to pursue.\n\nThere were, therefore, multiple reasons for a lack of autonomy that I had to figure out, and this challenge allowed me to delve deeper into the concept.

It can be intentional or unintentional, and affect people in nearly any context. Attributes, in this context, refers to people's characteristics, like skin color, occupation, or sexuality. These are a few of many potential examples. Potentially any characteristic may be cause for discrimination. Some characteristics are inherent, like skin color, meaning they cannot be changed, while others are not inherent and can be changed. Crucially, discrimination can be based on either. Though discrimination is possible in nearly any context, it can look different in different situations. For example, hiring discrimination in the workplace, or bullying in a classroom. Discrimination can also have many negative psychological impacts on those effected: here's a list of potential impacts from the American Psychological Association: https://www.apa.org/topics/racism-bias-discrimination/types-stress. Psychological impacts in this context are lasting effects on the person in question's mental and emotional wellbeing, exhibited in symptoms of behavior and response to behavior. Lastly, discrimination is a multi-front problem, and is never so simple as a single attribute. Its impact is 'intersectional,' meaning that it is felt as a consequence of multiple of the person's attributes, and is different than if it affected someone with only one of the multiple attributes in question.\" \nOperationalization:\n\"Before the survey I will ensure I collect informed consent from the participants, and assure them of their anonymity.\n\n\nIn a survey, I will ask people to answer yes/no whether they have experienced discrimination.

Intimacy is a state of being where two individuals share emotional closeness by opening up towards each other. Intimacy requires for both sides to be understanding and on the same page with each other.

The study will use a combination of joint and individual survey to show the different responses in love from different cultural contexts.

Individual survey will have the individuals reflect on if their partner presence while taking the survey together had an influence on the survey. This can help with if the joint and individual responses were different. Also, my survey will consider having open ended questions to have the participants share cultural values that has an impact on intimacy, passion, and commitment which can help with the diverse cultural backgrounds of each couples.  Intimacy: having the couples scale their relationship on 1-10 of how close and understanding they are in the relationship. 1 being they do not share intimacy at all while 10 being we are intimate everyday.  Passion: have the couples scale their relationship on 1-10 how strong their attachments are towards one another. 1 being we are not that strong on being attached towards one another while 10 is we are attached together and has a strong built up relationship. Commitment: Scaling the couples on 1-10 how likely it is to overcome obstacles as one. One being the lowest of not wanting to contribute into the relationship while 10 is they are willing to overcome obstacles and has a strong bond.My operationalization would be done by I will conduct a survey with about 5 different couples with different cultural backgrounds. I will survey them on how intimate their relationship is. I will have the 5 couples take the survey together as a couple in different rooms. Then I will separate the couples so individually they will be doing the same survey.

Autonomy is the ability to act on one's internal ability without external conflicts preventing or hindering said action.\n\nFinal Operationalization:\u00a0\n\nBefore the research begins, I would make sure that I am choosing a diverse cast of participants from a variety of different socieo-economic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds. Participants would be chosen from ages 18-65 with various sexes and gender orientations to best provide information on if age, sexual orientation, or gender affected how much freedom a participant could experience. The specifics of this degree of freedom experienced would be found in the questions following. All participant information would be made confidential and anonymous to the public and researchers to ensure a more comfortable environment for participants to answer honestly, ideally counteracting social desirability bias. I would also be sure to state at the beginning of the study that the word \"influence\" should be perceived both in a negative and positive way, and can mean social constructs like group opinion, individual opinion, orders, and similar constructs. \"influence\" also can mean internal influence from substance use in the form of addiction and addictive behaviors depending on what the question is asking for.\u00a0\n\nI would measure freedom with a survey that asks broad questions, such as \"how able are you to act on your decisions?,\" with the respondent being able to answer on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being \"very able\" and 1 being \"completely unable.\" I would also include questions that pertain to the participant's physical ability, such as, \"how influenced are you by any substances, including alcohol, tobacco, or other addictive substances?,\" with a similar scale of 10 being \"very influenced\" to 1 being \"not influenced at all.\" This particular question would be followed with \"to what degree do you feel that your physical ability or mental ability is influenced or changed by your use (chronic illness or conditions, addictive behavior, etc.) ,\" with 10 being \"significantly changed or influenced\" and 1 being \"not influenced or changed at all.\"\n\nI would measure independence by creating a survey with both open-ended measured questions and closed-ended measure questions. I would set up questions leading with the open-ended, such as, \"who are the top three individuals or groups in your life that influence your individual decision making on a daily basis, including both positive and negative influences? Please be specific when identifying these individuals or groups (Ex: Spouse, children, job, society, government, etc.)\" and then follow up with the closed-ended question \"to what degree do these individuals or groups influence your individual decision making.\" The closed ended questions will be followed with a 1-10 scale with 10 being \"heavily influence\" and 1 being \"not influenced at all.\" I would also include open-ended measure questions that target a participant's potential addictions, such as \"what are the top three substances (such as alcohol, tobacco/nicotine, etc.) that you consume,\" followed by a closed ended measure question, \"how often do you consume these substances,\" with a\u00a0\n\nI would measure sovereignty with a survey that has questions such as \"how often do you make your own decisions without the influence of things within your control?\", \"how often are you able to act upon your own decisions without being hindered by internal conflict?\" and providing a scale of 1-10, with 10 being \"very able/often\" and 1 being \"never/completely unable.\"\n\nI would measure autonomy with a survey that closed-ended measure questions such as \"how often does your career (workload, boss, position responsibilities, etc.) prevent you from acting on individual decisions,\" and/or \"how often does you partner/spouse prevent you from acting on individual decisions.\" Participants will be able to respond on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being \"always\" and 1 being \"not at all.\" This particular question can be followed with an open-ended measured question which is \"how do they prevent you from acting on your individual decisions (do they take your time, attention, monetary resources, etc.)\" and allow the participant to answer. I would also include questions in the survey that pertain to potential physical hindrances, such as \"how often does your physical health prevent you from acting on or influence your individual decisions? (chronic illness or conditions, difficulty exercising and performing basic physical tasks, etc.),\" and \"how often does your consumption of substances prevent you from acting upon or influence your individual?\" These questions will also be followed with a response scale of 1-10, with 10 being \"very often\" and 1 being \"not often at all.\"", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1706327828025, "student": {"_id": "65989ca3f619d8d44c5df979", "uid": "y9IZKGW2PaXuGxCLRDFkv9t3EMH3", "email": "afelde@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1704500387198, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Alec Conrad Felderman", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Therefore, within the possible variables of what freedom could entail, I determined it was necessary to define specific dimensions. The dimensions I selected were independence, sovereignty, and autonomy. I believed that these concepts built upon one another, and while they are all encapsulated within the broader notion of freedom, each one hints at a distinct aspect of what freedom entails.\n\nFor instance, sovereignty refers to the ability to act based upon one\u2019s own internal decisions and thoughts. Independence, on the other hand, is a broader physical state of being where one is undisturbed by unwanted potential influences. Autonomy means possessing the capacity to act on one\u2019s own decisions, whether mentally or physically, without being hindered or compelled by external forces.\n\nThis multifaceted approach was necessary because I needed to capture the full breadth of the concept to lend validity to my theory when I moved onto the operationalization phase of my study.

I would feel terrible and be unable to perform physically at my usual level. In such instances, you are, in essence, surrendering your freedom because you're allowing an influence to control your behavior and hinder you from making certain decisions.\n\nTake, for instance, a situation where I wake up with the intention of going for a run, but I'm suffering from a severe hangover or alcohol withdrawals. This physical state would prevent my body from successfully carrying out the activity. Therefore, despite my desire to exercise my freedom to choose to run, I am physically restricted from doing so. Although I might have the mental capacity to make the decision and contemplate it internally, the physical limitations caused by substance abuse impede me.\n\nThus, it is instances like these where substance abuse serves as an internal influence on what a person could potentially experience, impacting their autonomy and freedom."}, {"conversation_id": "65b47b6ae123e5924f24f138", "question": "You've made an interesting point about how substance abuse can limit one's freedom by restricting physical capabilities.

For instance, if given a choice between going out with friends or staying in to smoke, the addictive nature of certain substances might drive a person towards the latter option. Due to this addiction, the body becomes hardwired to crave the chemicals those substances produce, which can make a person feel enslaved to their cravings.\n\nIn a psychological sense, addiction can alter behavior and the way one approaches social decisions. Although someone might want to socialize, a severe addiction can physically prevent them from doing so. It might even lead to valuing the social event as irrelevant compared to the current need or desire for the substance.\n\nThe addiction creates a lack of autonomy because it diminishes control over one's actions.

To mitigate this, I stressed the importance of anonymity for all participants at the beginning of my essay. By eliminating the possibility of the researchers identifying the participants, I sought to ensure that respondents felt comfortable and were not influenced by societal pressures to alter their answers. This approach is intended to increase reliability by encouraging honest responses each time the survey is administered.\n\nWhile the bulk of the survey utilizes an ordinal scale from one to ten, I included some open-ended questions to allow for the categorization of responses, aiming to identify top categories for future research.

This anonymity ensures that the identities of those providing information remain unknown. Consequently, participants can feel confident that they are shielded from potential shame or public scrutiny that they might otherwise wish to avoid or that could reflect negatively on them. This level of protection encourages participants to provide more truthful responses.\n\nFurthermore, the use of anonymity allows researchers to obtain more accurate data, as the influence of social desirability bias is mitigated.

One potential challenge is that the use of a chatbot to pose questions and collect information might make participants feel less anonymous. With a bot having a voice or presenting a face, participants may start to feel uneasy, fearing a lack of anonymity despite being assured of it at the start of the research. This perceived human-like presence could influence them to be untruthful in how they respond to the questions.\n\nOn the other hand, a chatbot could enhance the interaction by presenting the questions in a more conversational manner. This could encourage respondents to engage in a more natural dialogue, potentially adding nuance and variety to how they answer the questions. Such conversational dynamics might increase the validity of the responses, which could be particularly beneficial in understanding concepts like freedom in my study.\n\nHowever, this same increase in nuance and the variety of responses may also reduce the reliability, presenting a challenge in interpreting the nuances of autonomy itself. A chatbot's conversational nature could lead to a broader range of answers that may be more difficult to classify and analyze consistently.\n\nIn conclusion, while a chatbot might challenge my operational definitions\u2014which rely heavily on obtaining reliable and valid responses through ensured anonymity\u2014it could also provide a platform for more honest and nuanced communication. It is essential to weigh these potential advantages against the risks to ensure accurate information gathering."}]}, "66a9b8cc581dde68a052a249": {"_id": "66a9b8cc581dde68a052a249", "created_at": 1722398924685, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "1.\n\nBeauty can be defined as a quality or set of qualities that provide a sense of pleasure or satisfaction to the mind, characterized by attributes such as appeal and harmony. It encompasses multiple dimensions, including physical beauty, which involves attributes like proportion and symmetry that please the visual senses, contributing to aesthetic harmony and visual appeal. Inner beauty consists of traits such as kindness, empathy, and intelligence that enrich human relationships and provide emotional satisfaction. Additional dimensions of beauty may include aesthetic beauty, which involves qualities in art and design like color balance, innovation, and cohesion that offer intellectual and sensory pleasure. Then, natural beauty, which pertains to the visual appeal of natural landscapes and environments, is often characterized by diversity and harmony. These dimensions together ensure that beauty is seen as a multifaceted concept, with each dimension distinctly defined and contributing to the overall experience of beauty.\u00a0\n\n2.\u00a0\n\nPhysical beauty:\n\n1. Face symmetry: Use image analysis software for precise measurement of symmetry. This aligns with visual appeal and is practical in dermatology.\u00a0\n\n2. Body proportions: Assess with photographic measurements and established ratios, using tools like body measurement software. This reflects visual appeal and is feasible in clinical settings.\u00a0\n\nInner beauty:\u00a0\n\n1. Empathy: Measure using standardized scales like the Empathy Quotient, which is widely used in psychological research.\u00a0\n\n2. Kindness: Track through self-report questionnaires to document acts of kindness, relevant for assessing inner beauty.\u00a0\n\n3. Intelligence: Assess with standardized IQ tests or cognitive tasks, feeling well with the concept of inner beauty.\u00a0\n\nAesthetic beauty:\n\n1. Color balance: evaluate color schemes, using color theory, analysis, and tools, aligning with sensory appeal and creativity.\u00a0\n\n2. Innovation: assess creativity, through expert reviews are scoring rubrics, that fits with aesthetic originality.\u00a0\n\n3. Cohesion: Measure visual harmony with evaluation forms used by art critics, relevant for assessing artistic integration.\u00a0\n\nNatural beauty:\u00a0\n\n1. Scenic views: Rate landscapes using beauty assessment tools or surveys, aligning with visual appeal in nature.\u00a0\n\n2. Biodiversity: Measure species diversity and ecosystem, healthy ecological surveys, fitting with natural beauty.\u00a0\n\n3. Environmental health: Assess air and water quality with environmental monitoring equipment, reflecting ecological and visual appeal.\u00a0\n\n3.\n\nTo check the reliability of the indicators in the overall beauty score, you can use two main methods. Internal consistency involves seeing different parts of an indicator light questions on a skin condition scale give similar results when used with the same people. It also includes making sure that all indicators together consistently reflect the concept of beauty by using statistical tests. Test-retest reliability involves giving the same indicator to the same people at different times and seeing if the results are the same for the final beauty store you can check if it stays consistent with measurements at different times to ensure it reliably represents a concept of beauty.\n\n4.\u00a0\n\nResearchers would use a survey to apply the indicators. They would create questions about aspects like facial symmetry, empathy, and scenic beauty, and then ask her diverse group of people to fill it out. The survey would be designed to ensure clear instructions to participants understand how to answer. To avoid bias and protect privacy, the survey would be sensitive to cultural differences and guarantee confidentiality.

It manifests in four main dimensions:\n\nPhysical Manifestations: A chronic or semi-chronic sense of tension or general tightness/discomfort in the body, such as tightness in the abdomen or chest, chronic muscle tension (e.g., clenched fists, stiff legs), and uncontrollable physical tics (e.g., fingernail biting, eye tic, facial grimace).\n\nEmotional Reactions: A persistent sense of worry or apprehension about upcoming situations, difficulty in dismissing concerns from the mind, and overwhelming feelings of apprehension regardless of the situation's actual severity.\n\nBehavioral Changes: Observable changes in behavior, such as social withdrawal, procrastination, and reduced productivity and activity levels.\n\nImpacts on Mental Wellbeing: Effects on mental health, including living in a semi-constant state of fear, experiencing depression, and reduced enjoyment or investment in other life experiences.\u00a0\n\n\n2) Indicators:\u00a0\n\nI find myself performing impulsive, repetitive behaviors such as biting my fingernails or pulling my hair when I am worried about something (physical manifestations), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\nI often feel a pervasive tightness/tension in my chest due to worry (physical manifestations), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\nI often find myself not being able to stop thinking about upcoming things that I am nervous about (emotional reactions), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\nI am often stuck with a general feeling of dread or like something bad is going to happen to me (emotional reaction), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\nWhen I am worried about something, I find myself drawing away from people and social situations (behavioral changes), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\nWhen I am worried about something, I find it difficult to focus and to do productive activities that I feel I should carry out (behavioral changes), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\nI find myself not enjoying fun or social events when I am worrying about something (impacts of mental wellbeing), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\nI spend many days feeling down or low-energy because of mental exhaustion (impacts of mental wellbeing), answer on a scale of 1-10, 1 being \"Strongly disagree\" and 10 being \"Strongly agree\"\n\n\n\n\n3) Numerical representation:\n\nI will add the numbers together and average them, and the higher the average the more likely it is that somebody has a high stress level. This is because there are many different manifestations of stress, and somebody does not have to exhibit all of them to have stress, but are more likely to have it if they exhibit more symptoms, so an unweighted average seems like the most reliable system to me personally. The level of measurement of the combined numerical representation is also ordinal.\n\n\n\n\n4) Procedures for applying indicators:\n\nThis is a survey, as the researcher would be able to send out an online questionnaire to a set of people to be taken and submitted digitally.

It wasn't until I discussed it with my therapist, who pointed out that my severe stress was undermining my motivation, that I made the connection. Remarkably, once I managed my stress, my motivation levels improved, enabling me to tackle tasks like studying and avoiding procrastination.\n\nI used these insights to develop an operational definition of stress that includes obvious indicators like worrying, as well as less obvious ones. By doing this, I feel I have encompassed the entire concept of anxiety and stress rather than just focusing on a few aspects.\n\nThe fact that the definition averages the overall score based on the intensity and number of symptoms rather than specific symptoms enhances its reliability. People experience different aspects of stress. For instance, one person might not fidget or bite their nails but might withdraw from social situations and lack motivation. This approach allows individuals with different symptoms to be assessed as having a similar level of stress, thus increasing the reliability of the definition.

Beyond those broad categories that I got from the surveys and my own knowledge of anxiety, I was able to develop specific questions based on my experiences and my mom's experiences. For instance, my mom has panic attacks when she is under high stress. Although I didn't include that as it's a higher level of anxiety, I did note how her anxiety spiked after a car crash. When her anxiety was high, she couldn't bring herself to drive a car because she was afraid something bad would happen. This shows a lack of motivation, where she knew she needed to drive but just couldn't do it.\n\nI realized that motivation is an important aspect to consider, so I included a question about it.

Body image dissatisfaction, in a sense, encompasses the negative feelings an individual gets when comparing their body image to the \"desired\" body image set by society.\n\nFirst, struggling with \u201cappreciating how your body looks\u201d refers to the feelings and emotions that many get when struggling to love one's own body image reflection. This encompasses the emotional distress dimension of body image dissatisfaction. Emotional distress refers to the emotions and feelings some might get from their body image dissatisfaction that would cause extreme distress to their everyday life. This is where an individual might feel anxious, depressed, shameful, disappointed, or guilty because of their body image. This can manifest as feeling unworthy, anti-social, and in some cases even suicidal as a result of extreme body image dissatisfaction. \n\nSecond, \"external factors, such as social media\" refers to the reality of comparing your body image to others through depictions posted on a variety of social media applications. This encompasses the social comparison dimension of body image dissatisfaction. Social comparison refers to when an individual might compare themselves to others on social media resulting in extreme body image dissatisfaction. This is where an individual might feel different, unworthy, or ashamed of themselves compared to others they see in a social environment. This can manifest as being anti-social, distancing yourself from others due to feelings of shame and disappointment, and losing all sense of self. \n\nFinal Set of Indicators and Their Associated Levels of Measurement: \n\n\u201cI have always thought that my body was less satisfying to look at compared to others\u201d (emotional distress) - participants respond on a 5 point scale from very strongly agree to very strongly disagree [Ordinal Level of Measurement]\n\u201cI feel anxious, shameful, or guilty whenever I see myself in the mirror\u201d (emotional distress) - participants respond on a 5 point scale from very strongly agree to very strongly disagree [Ordinal Level of Measurement]\n\u201cWhen I see people posting their body to social media, I compare my body to theirs\u201d (social comparison) - participants respond on a 5 point scale from very strongly agree to very strongly disagree [Ordinal Level of Measurement]\n\u201cI feel like I have to hide my body image on social media with the fear of what others might think or say\u201d (social comparison) - participants respond on a 5 point scale from very strongly agree to very strongly disagree [Ordinal Level of Measurement]\n\nHow I Plan to Combine Those Indicators and Level of Measurement of Combined Numerical Representation:\n \nWhen considering how I am going to combine my indicators to represent a single numerical representation of my concept, I plan to average the scores. Given that there are 6 indicators, I will add the scores of each indicator together and divide the total by 6 to get the average. I am choosing to average them to get a numerical representation of my concepts because this allows for a simple interpretation of the data collected. While understanding that the survey is an ordinal level of measurement with differences and order, the averaging of the data will also allow for me to notice any trends or patterns in the responses.\nThe level of measurement of the combined numerical representation is the interval level of measurement. As defined in this course, the interval level of measurement involves knowing that there are differences, we know that there is order, and we can measure the differences. Given that we as social sciences strongly believe that people in their minds understand the difference between strongly disagree and slightly disagree to be the same amount as strongly agree and slightly agree in the context of survey data, we would treat this level of measurement as interval, even though the individual responses are ordinal.\n\nThe Procedures for Applying these Indicators for Data Collection: \n\nWhen considering how I will apply these indicators, I have decided that I will give a survey online to my participants. My target population would be high school and college students in King County at both public and private schools, specifically those students who also engage in social media usage. I will have a convenience sample and I will recruit participants specifically through different public and private high schools and colleges in King County who engage in social media usage, as social comparison is a huge dimension in body image dissatisfaction. Given that many might feel anxious to share their feelings towards their body image, I will ensure that participants are instructed that the survey is confidential and unanimous as part of the informed consent process. To further ensure this confidentiality in the study, the results and data collected will be kept in a secure location that only myself will know and have access to.\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1722567053776, "student": {"_id": "669c4f04205cfb6e322237da", "uid": "XL1MDq3k38ZoHkniiFxpp9PNAaN2", "email": "jas92@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1721519876342, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Jordan Anthony Schneider", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

One limitation regarding test-retest reliability is the fact that, even though you're retesting people with a 15 to 30-minute interval between tests or surveys, there is an issue with ensuring that the participants' answers are truthful. You're not really testing the limitation of knowing whether or not they remember their previous responses accurately and whether those responses are reliable and truthful reflections of their feelings. \n\nInsights include being able to check the credibility and reliability of the survey as a method of research and data collection from participants. However, a main limitation that could arise with the test-retest theory when using chatbots is the challenge of determining if participants' responses are truly accurate and reliable. This is due to the uncertainty of whether their memory of their previous responses is influencing their current answers, or if their answers are an accurate representation of how they actually feel.

When individuals compare themselves to others and find that they are not as thin or curvy or attractive as others based on society standards, this can lead to negative thoughts about oneself. When individuals think that they are lacking in comparison to the beauty standard, this can lead to them feeling embarrassment or even depression and anxiety, due to them seeing a difference between their own body and the ideal beauty standard. This can lead to eating disorders or excessive exercising and even avoiding social interactions to hide what they see as a fault. While there are many factors that contribute to what the societal beauty standards are, a big one includes media portrayal of what attractiveness is. Many influencers are often very thin or considered conventionally attractive, and they are often shown in a very widespread way and advertised as the picture of attractiveness and beauty.\n\nindicator for how often people look at their bodies in a negative way compared to others.\n\nquestion: how often do you look at your body in a negative way compared to others?\n\nnever, rarely, sometimes, often, always\n\n\n\n\nindicator for how often people avoid social interactions due to their body image.\n\nquestion: how often do you avoid social interactions due to your body image?\n\nnever, rarely, sometimes, often, always\n\n\n\n\nindicator for how often people diet to change their body image.\n\nquestion: how often do you diet in order to change your body image?\n\nnever, rarely, sometimes, often, always\n\n\n\n\nindicator for how often people look to social media as their way of seeing the ideal body figure.\n\nquestion: how often do you look at social media for the ideal body figure?\n\nnever, rarely, sometimes, often, always\n\n\n\n\nindicator for how often body image contributes to thoughts of depression or anxiety.\n\nquestion: how often do thoughts of your body image contribute to anxiety or depression?\n\nnever, rarely, sometimes, often, always\n\nI will assign each of the options a score so never to always will be numbers 1-5 respectively.

Accountability is when someone takes complete ownership for a harmful or incorrect action. This requires communicating, either verbally or in writing, to anyone who was impacted and committing to improvement moving forward. Communication must be prompt, honest, transparent, and sincere. Step one would be acknowledging the impact that my decision had to the individual, and how it affected them. An example of this in the community would be if I stepped on someone's shoes. I would immediately apologize and promise to be more careful of my steps.\u00a0 Step two would be asking them how it impacted them and listening for any additional suggestions to avoid the same mistake. An example in the workplace would be if I kept entering the wrong numbers in the accounting ledger, I could ask my boss for ways to improve and shore up my work.\u00a0 Step 3 would be keeping a journal of when I admit my wrong and also document the feedback I receive so that I can reflect on it. A personal example would be if I lied to a friend about something, and I called them to apologize for lying and then told them the truth. I would document this entire conversation. Step 4 would be committing to improvement and reaching out to the people that I impacted to share how my progress is going and seek any additional feedback. An example in school would be if I did not contribute enough to a group project. I would vow to be more engaged early on in the week and reach out to group mates to apologize and also do progress checks.\u00a0\n\n2. The first indicator of accountability would be showing remorse with a sincere, genuine apology. For example, if I dropped my mom's vase, I would sincerely apologize and admit that I was not being careful enough. The second indicator would be providing the aggrieved people with an opportunity to give feedback, and actively listening by asking questions and summarizing.\u00a0 For example, if I cost my team the baseball game by striking out four times, I would give me coaches and teammates an opportunity to critique my swing and give me advice on hitting, while asking questions along the way and taking notes. The third indicator would be commitment to improvement by providing tangible, measurable goals for improvement. Set a time frame (once a month, once every two weeks) to check in with yourself on your progress. An example would be if I am continually late to work, I check in with my boss once every week to evaluate my timeliness and track my progress since the past week. The fourth indicator would be if the person has any strategies to avoid the mistake. This could including looking up strategies online, asking a parent or mentor for advice, and writing these goals down in a journal or personal blog. An example would be if I continue to mispronounce a colleague's name, I ask them how it is pronounced, look up the phonetic spelling, and practice saying it at home. The fifth indicator would be if the person follows up with the people they harmed to discuss their progress. An example would be if I owed someone money and continued to be late re-paying them. I could take a financial management class and share my progress with the person I owe while getting back on track with on-time payments. All interval level.\n\n3. For each of my indicators, I would use the Likert scale, and assign a numerical value to each option 1-5, after receiving the responses. Completely Disagree would be 1, and Completely Agree would be 5. Since I have five indicators, I would take the total score and divide it by 5 to get a total score. \u00a0\n\n4. My procedure would be a survey. The target audience would be to cast as wide a net as possible, I would want answers from people of all different, ages, backgrounds, locations. I would want to avoid any bias towards any group, but I also would like to see if there are any patterns I notice in answers from people who have commonalities. Special instructions would be that these surveys would be available online, but there would also be an opportunity to take the survey in a classroom setting at a local community college, for those who do not have internet access. There would be compensation provided for each participant as an incentive to have as many participants as possible. I would advertise the survey on social media and I would have posters around town and the community college with a QR code to take survey. i would also ask the college to send out an email to all students with an invitation. A community college would be chosen as the location because they tend to have a wide variety of ages and backgrounds of students enrolled, and also have classrooms available as well as public transportation for those who want or need to take it in person. For the online test, there would be options to choose your preferred language (as many options as possible), and for those taking the survey online, there would be paper copies of the survey available in as many languages as possible. The questions that are in other languages would translated as accurately as possible.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1722575773720, "student": {"_id": "6699adbe205cfb6e322237b4", "uid": "ZCzulcgHs6eVkaLangMkIId1Hmm2", "email": "adsmith7@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1721347518331, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Anthony Smith", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Also, as I wrote about, I might have different people administer the surveys because if someone sees who it is\u2014if it's in person\u2014and they recognize it's me, they might have some sort of connection to me and want to avoid looking bad.

Final Conceptual Definition: Grief is the emotional response to experiencing a loss. This loss refers to the emotional impact when someone or something meaningful is removed from one's life (e.g., a loved one, a pet, a sentimental piece of jewelry). Grief typically results from a permanent loss, and can lead to feelings such as sorrow, sadness, anger, agony, and distress, though these emotions can vary greatly from person to person.\n\nGrief involves the removal of a reliance or foundation in one's life, often related to valued relationships. This can include familial relationships, friendships, other human connections, and pets that one relies on for support.\u00a0\n\nGrief, particularly in extreme cases, is a nonlinear process. The term 'nonlinear' aptly describes the emotional journey of grief, as there is no distinct timeline or order in which one experiences it. One may feel grief in consistent, recurring waves or may skip through various emotions altogether. It is important to recognize that the feelings stemming from grief, ranging from denial to depression, are only parts of a larger, complex overall experience. Understanding grief as an all-encompassing emotional process highlights its individuality, and the varying intensity and impact it has on each person.\n\n2. Final Set of indicators and their associated level of measurement: \"My grief significantly impacted my life.\" (emotional impact) - Participants respond on a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (Very strongly disagree) to 7 (Very strongly agree). - Interval level of measurement\n\n\"I felt like my emotions and outlook on life changed because of my grief.\" (emotional impact) - Participants respond on a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (Very strongly disagree) to 7 (Very strongly agree). - Interval level of measurement\n\n\"What I lost provided a primary and consistent source of support and happiness in my life.\" (removal of foundation in one's life) - Participants respond on a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (Very strongly disagree) to 7 (Very strongly agree). - Interval level of measurement\n\n\"I felt lost without the advice and guidance that what I lost provided.\" (removal of foundation in one's life) - Participants respond on a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (Very strongly disagree) to 7 (Very strongly agree). - Interval level of measurement\n\n\"My grieving process was unpredictable and I felt a wide range of emotions (e.g. sadness, anger, guilt).\" (nonlinear process) - Participants respond on a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (Very strongly disagree) to 7 (Very strongly agree). - Interval level of measurement\n\n\"I experienced grief on a daily basis, with varying intensity and emotions.\" (nonlinear process) - Participants respond on a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (Very strongly disagree) to 7 (Very strongly agree). - Interval level of measurement\n\n\n3. How you are going to combine those indicators and what the level of measurement of the combined numerical representation will be: As all of my indicators are aligned by the Likert scale in a generalizable way, essentially, a lower score (lowest being 6 - \u00a01 point minimum x 6 indicators) would mean one was all-around less affected by their grief, and a higher score (highest being 42 - 7 points maximum x 6 indicators) would mean they were more effected. Adding the individual indicators into a collective score, with each indicator response being weighed the same will give me the best idea about how one was affected by their grief process. This whole representation is equitably assessed through the weight of the questions and generalizability of the questions. The combined numerical representations would be of the interval level of measurement.\n\n4. The procedures for applying these indicators for data collection: This would be a survey that participants would take on their own, making it a self report survey. Their answers will be assessed on a scale of 1-7, ranging from 1 being very strongly disagree, and 7 being very strongly agree. There will be a neutral response at 4 which will likely say \"prefer not to answer\" and will not affect their overall score. The overall score will be 42 possible points, the higher a score is, the higher grief has seemingly affected that individual. The survey is for anyone who has lost someone, or potentially something, and has experienced grief in any capacity. It will be a good idea however to seek out a variety of types of grief individuals went through to best understand both grief as a collective and specific types of grief. An example of this would be having an even amount of participants who have lost their mother, father, best friend, pet, and so on.

In asking these two questions, we have a generalizable idea of grief that we can then analyze further to make connections.

I may have understood that myself before, but I didn't express it in a way that made it applicable elsewhere.

I talked about grief as not just losing a loved one but also losing someone who provides tangible aspects in your life. I wanted to encompass that in the process of grief.\n\nI chose grief as an indicator because, like the nonlinear aspect of grief, it is measurable and widely applicable. For example, if someone loses their mother, who used to cook and clean for them, their life drastically changes. This change is not just emotional; their support system is gone, and their happiness is affected. There are many different subsets to grief, and conceptualizing it helped me realize these various aspects. \n\nI believe grief is a good indicator because it is something people can respond to without necessarily focusing on their direct feelings. Asking someone whether they lost a support system or whether their happiness was affected is a straightforward, answerable question. This is easier to address on a Likert scale compared to more complex questions about the grieving process.

I think it takes time and reflection. From my personal experience, losing someone is something that you have to reconcile with. That's why, initially when conceptualizing grief, I believed using the five stages of grief would be a great example. However, it turned out not to be, and the chatbot made me realize that. \n\nConsidering grief in relation to the question of losing a primary source of support and how it might influence the different stages of the grieving process is a valuable approach. You have to consider all options. When looking at grief and understanding the loss of support, you\u2019re reconciling emotional support and also the loss of tangible aid in your life. For example, say someone lost a parent or a brother. We had already used losing a mother as an example. Losing a brother means losing someone to confide in, someone who you could go to for almost anything without getting into trouble like with parents.\n\nThe idea of grief is highly applicable to research and other areas, and that\u2019s why I was so intrigued by it. By asking questions through a Likert scale, you can really see the specific ways grief impacts people's lives. It's not just sadness or crying all the time; it's about reconciling with the understanding that you\u2019re not going to get certain aspects of your life back that you had before. Often, as humans, we take those aspects of our life for granted. That is another part of the research process that I could have explored. Specifically, I could've discussed how people's lives have changed as a result of their loss, where they are now compared to before, how they are feeling now, and whether or not they have been able to rebound from this loss of structure in their life.\n\nIt's fascinating to think about because grief is something that, as a collective, most humans are afraid of\u2014death and loss. Most of the time, you're afraid of losing someone else before you. You don't want to imagine losing someone because it's part of this grieving process. The loss of certain foundational aspects that we don't realize on the surface is what truly frightens us. It\u2019s the thought that our lives will be totally different without this person because we rely on them for so much and don\u2019t realize it on a daily basis."}, {"conversation_id": "66ac6f9f581dde68a05cf038", "question": "Your response was too short!

I'm not sure if they recorded that; I didn't realize we had a time limit here. This is the part of the conceptualization or authorization that I struggle with the most: determining how to use a predetermined methodology in applying these indicators. I wanted to use these indicators to broadly determine who is experiencing loss and grief in general. I didn't want to measure just specific people; I wanted to measure as many people as I could. In doing so, with many different kinds of responses, I sought to identify different subsets of people experiencing different types of grief.\n\nOnce we have these varied responses, we can compare the experiences of people who, for example, lost their mother versus those who lost their dog and observe if there are differences in their scores. I aimed to make my indicators as broad and applicable to any person as possible. I made sure not to refer to the loss of a loved one specifically, as it could potentially include the loss of something significant as well.\n\nThe chatbot was quite helpful in this process. Initially, I talked specifically about loved ones, even though that wasn't my goal. I realized that the language I used was too narrow and confined for a proper working authorization definition. For instance, I asked how people's emotional states were before and after their loss and grief. This approach helped measure how grief impacted their lives, which was my main objective. Comparing these responses will be useful, and I can analyze the data using measures of reliability and validity to delve deeply into the questions I was interested in.\n\nI believe my measurements of reliability and validity were applicable. Using the Likert scale was of particular interest to me because it conveys broad information. These responses were self-reported, ensuring that participants answered based on their true feelings rather than saying what they thought someone wanted to hear. People are likely to be honest about their grief because it is deeply personal and something they want to express. This makes the study reliably authentic, as they face no consequences for their responses.\n\nI attempted to make everything universally applicable, reliable, and valid. I tested this through face validity and discussed test-retest reliability, knowing that the grieving process differs greatly over time. One person might feel one way in one month and differently six months later, reflecting the varied nature of grief.

I don't believe that this has any effect on reliability. As I mentioned, I think the methods of reliability that I used, such as test-retest and internal consistency, were really applicable in determining the specificities I was looking for. The Likert scale, for example, can do so much to show varied responses and different kinds of grief, which is incredibly useful for us. Grief is a universal experience rather than focusing on one specific kind. Therefore, we essentially gain a double facet of usefulness: on one hand, we have these predicted measures that we expect, such as internal consistency, where we hypothesize that someone whose mother just recently died will score very high on the scale, whereas someone whose dog died five years ago might have a lower score. \n\nIf these predictions do not align, while this does affect reliability, it also provides insight that grief is not the linear process we thought it to be. Consequently, we may need to go back to the drawing board and reframe these questions to be more specific if reliability is affected. However, I don't think grief is something easily disproven because it is such an inherent human experience. The generalizable measurability of the Likert scale made our answers concise and allowed us to check them quickly. For example, with the test-retest method, we could easily determine if someone is feeling differently than before by comparing the two numbers quickly. If there were a lot of inconsistencies, we would likely go back to the drawing board and reconsider our approach. We might talk to people throughout their grieving processes to see how their experiences differ instead of putting a definitive number on it.

Welcome to our conversation. I just read your essay and found your use of a 7-point scale for measuring different aspects of security really interesting. I'm curious\u2014what was your thought process behind choosing those particular indicators for physical, mental, and emotional security? Did you face any challenges while defining them?", "question_num": 1, "uuid": "06aad2fc-dc6c-4184-bb61-01b051a05038", "created_at": 1722593187683, "response": "so i chose the seven point scale because it offered a pretty wide range of responses from very strongly disagree to very strongly agree it also is an odd number and from the course content we learned that that's best because it kind of provides a middle point and then an equal amount on each side and then as far as the thought process behind choosing the particular indicators physical mental and emotional security i just feel like those are all pretty general levels of security that a person might feel at a given point i also feel like mental and emotional are really different as far as security is concerned some people might think of them as the same but i do think that the actual emotions that someone's feeling versus you know different feelings such as like fear or stress are really different than emotions like happiness or sadness i think they're all different indicators of someone's security and then obviously physical safety is probably what a lot of people think of first it's what i thought of first so that's also why there's two questions just because that's a pretty broad one that i think is gonna be pretty relevant to the actual study as far as facing any challenges while defining them oh oh never mind sorry a little bit because i think that i a little bit tried to get too broad at one point and tried to kind of bring methods of security into it as far as like protecting yourself protecting others and i think i needed to step back and just go back to the actual definition of security and how just kind of the average person would define it rather than kind of trying to get in into like a verb", "improved_response": "So, I chose the seven-point scale because it offers a wide range of responses, from \"very strongly disagree\" to \"very strongly agree.\" It is also an odd number, and from the course content, we learned that this is ideal because it provides a middle point with an equal number of options on each side. \n\nAs for the thought process behind choosing the particular indicators\u2014physical, mental, and emotional security\u2014I feel these are all general levels of security that a person might experience at any given point. I also believe that mental and emotional security are quite different. Some people might think of them as the same, but I consider the actual emotions someone feels, such as happiness or sadness, to be distinct from feelings like fear or stress. I think they are all different indicators of someone's security. \n\nAdditionally, physical safety is probably what a lot of people think of first\u2014it's what I thought of first. That's also why there are two questions about physical safety, as it is a broad area that I believe will be relevant to the actual study.\n\nRegarding the challenges I faced while defining these indicators, I initially found myself getting too broad. I tried to include methods of security, such as protecting oneself and others. However, I realized I needed to step back and focus on the actual definition of security, considering how the average person would define it rather than delving into specific protective actions."}, {"conversation_id": "66acaecb581dde68a0a7dde3", "question": "It's great that you differentiated between mental and emotional security in your indicators.

Security is the feeling or state of being secure within a given situation. The chatbot gave me some feedback, noting that my definition was a bit broad. By the third definition, I had refined it to: security is the perception that one is secure within a given situation. I believe this accurately captures that security is more of an internal state or feeling rather than an external one.\n\nThroughout my work, I transitioned from viewing security as a feeling or state to more of a perception. This shift in understanding developed progressively. Initially, I thought about physical security, which was the first thing that came to my mind. From there, my thoughts expanded to mental security and then emotional security, evolving in a sort of web fashion.\n\nOnce I had these categories, I focused on defining each dimension clearly, especially distinguishing between mental and emotional security. This clarity was essential to my work."}, {"conversation_id": "66acaecb581dde68a0a7dde3", "question": "It's interesting that you described how your definition evolved from being broad to more specific regarding perception.

I had the idea of feeling psychologically safe and secure with my own thoughts, which pertained to mental security. Then, there was the idea of feeling emotionally stable and secure with my own feelings. After receiving more feedback from the chatbot, I realized that these concepts needed to be more narrowly defined. \n\nTo clarify, I provided some examples: feeling psychologically safe and free from threats to my mental state, such as fear, grief, and stress. These feelings are more related to mental states rather than emotions. \n\nOn the other hand, feeling emotionally secure and free from threats to my emotional state included feelings like anger, shame, and anxiety. These represent different sets of feelings, with one set being more about mental states and the other more about emotional states. I aimed to provide clear examples so that respondents could differentiate these more easily."}, {"conversation_id": "66acaecb581dde68a0a7dde3", "question": "It's great to hear how you narrowed down the definitions with specific examples. Now, moving on to a related concept, you discussed the indicators for physical, mental, and emotional security. Explain how you ensured the validity and reliability of your operational definitions. How did you address potential threats to these aspects in your essay?", "question_num": 4, "uuid": "36cd52d1-6a47-4eb3-87b8-fb985a77bc73", "created_at": 1722593602548, "response": "so as far as validity goes i thought the criterion based validity would be pretty useful because there's a pretty i feel like widely accepted acknowledged set of kind of traits that you would expect to see with either security or lack of security so lack of security someone would probably be feeling some stress anxiety or a lack of safety where if someone was feeling pretty secure calm relaxed peaceful and furthermore it'd be pretty hard to feel like you were being threatened and your sage is being threatened by but also be calm relaxed and peaceful so i think that comparing those and comparing someone's level of security with what you would expect them to be feeling emotionally and comparing those would be really useful and then as far as reliability goes obviously you test and retesting you would expect answers to be pretty similar i mentioned this in on canvas but you also would definitely wanna keep the environment the exact same because obviously you wouldn't wanna introduce anything that might be triggering someone to feel physically emotionally or mentally threatened if you change it between those two then you're really not doing the same study again you're not retesting it you're introducing an external kind of variable there that is kind of getting rid of the control in order to retest so that would be kind of a challenge but definitely something important because this one could be so easily skewed i also did think that intercoder reliability would be used at some point by just seeing how different respondents associate different words with security just to make sure that we're reliably associating the same terms in the actual indicators to what people would expect to to be associated and what people are actually feeling in response to these words", "improved_response": "As far as validity goes, I thought criterion-based validity would be pretty useful because there is a widely accepted set of traits you would expect to see with either security or lack of security. For example, someone lacking security would probably feel stress, anxiety, or a lack of safety, whereas someone feeling secure would likely be calm, relaxed, and peaceful. \n\nFurthermore, it would be hard to feel threatened and calm, relaxed, and peaceful at the same time. So, comparing someone's level of security with their emotional state and comparing those metrics would be really useful.\n\nAs for reliability, obviously, you would expect similar answers through test-retesting. I mentioned this on Canvas, but you also definitely want to keep the environment the same. This is crucial because introducing anything that might make someone feel physically, emotionally, or mentally threatened would mean you're not conducting the same study again. You're introducing an external variable that removes the control necessary for retesting, which is a challenge but also very important. This study could be easily skewed if these factors aren\u2019t controlled.\n\nI also think that intercoder reliability would be used at some point by examining how different respondents associate different words with security. This would ensure we are reliably associating the same terms in the indicators to match what people expect and what they are actually feeling in response to these words."}, {"conversation_id": "66acaecb581dde68a0a7dde3", "question": "I found your explanation about criterion-based validity quite insightful, particularly how you linked emotional states like calmness with security.

This would likely mean no artwork on the walls, no other people in the room, or anything else that could introduce variables, thus keeping it as controlled as possible. \n\nHowever, if we were interested in seeing how the environment changes someone's level of security, we could compare their responses in this controlled environment to how they feel in a public park or a similar setting. It's important to ensure that everyone feels comfortable and consents to what we are doing. \n\nOne point of interest could be studying how a large group of people influences someone's sense of security, whether positively or negatively. This would certainly be an intriguing aspect to examine. \n\nTherefore, if our goal is to eliminate influencing factors, maintaining a consistently secure environment is crucial.

We naturally have these biases inside us, so we may unintentionally be more aggressive towards another race or ethnicity due to these internal perceptions that we learn as we get older. This kind of forms our thinking about people, and through that, I believe microaggressions can often be unintentional because of these ingrained perceptions. \n\nFor example, if you grew up learning from your parents or peers that Turkish people are terrible, you might naturally be more aggressive towards Turkish people. That\u2019s just one example; I'm not sure how relevant it is, but it's what comes to mind right now. \n\nThere are also gender-based biases.

It can be understood in two dimensions: internal and external authenticity. Internally, it involves a strong belief in one\u2019s self-worth, where one feels deserving of a high quality of life and will not settle for less, takes pride in personal decisions and traits, and experiences genuine self-love, meaning unwavering support and belief in oneself. Externally, authenticity means appreciating and valuing one's physical attributes as they are, recognizing beauty in one's reflection without striving to meet societal standards, and embracing a unique style. Authenticity also requires fearlessness in the face of judgment, confidently standing by who you are and your personal choices, unbothered by criticism or societal norms.\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\"I believe I am worthy of a high quality of life.\" (internal authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I often feel satisfied with my achievements and progress in life.\" (internal authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I am confident in making decisions that reflect my true preferences.\" (internal authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\" I often feel proud of the decisions I make\" (internal authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I treat myself kindly when I make a mistake or fail \" (internal authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\" I frequently use positive and encouraging self-talk. \" (internal authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\" I often remind myself of my worth and abilities. \" (internal authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I appreciate my body for what it can do. \" (external authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I often feel satisfied with my physical appearance without comparing myself to others \" (external authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I am comfortable with my body as it is. \" (external authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I feel confident about my physical appearance in social settings. \" (external authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I recognize and appreciate my personal beauty when I look in the mirror. \" (external authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\" I often choose outfits based on what I like rather than what others might think.\" (external authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I feel confident expressing my unique style. \" (external authenticity) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I often make choices that align with my beliefs, even if they contradict societal norms. \" (fearlessness) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\" I often stand by my personal choices, even in the face of criticism\" (fearlessness) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n\"I frequently express my true opinions, even if they might be unpopular. \" (fearlessness) Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"very strongly agree\" to \"very strongly disagree\"\n3.

It encompasses all characteristics combined to capture the\nessence of femininity.\n-Mannerisms and Behaviors: These are subjective but often include being\nmaternal, having gentle hands, being domestic, and always appearing well\nput together.\n\n-Maternal: Being maternal is showing empathy, nurturing behaviors, and\nprotective.\n\n2.\n\n- Aesthetics\n\nHair: Long, well-maintained, and styled.\nNails: Long, painted, and groomed to elongate features to enhance\nfemininity.\nAppearance: Physical attributes that align with societal standards of\nbeauty, such as clear skin, symmetrical features, thin body depending on\nsocietal standards, could differ within cultural context.\nFashion: Clothing and accessories that are stylish, flattering, and\nconsidered trendy or well thought-out.\n\n-Essence\n\nCommunication Style: Use of a warm, gentle tone, with empathetic and\nsupportive language.\nBody Language: Graceful, fluid movements; open, welcoming gestures; and\nmaintaining a relaxed and composed posture. For example, graceful hands,\ngentle smiles and gentle eyes, having good posture but still looking\nnatural.\n\n-Mannerisms and Behaviors\n\nDomestic: Regular engagement in household chores, maintaining a clean and\norganized living space, and preparing meals with attention to detail and\ncare. For example, having laundry folded right out of the dryer, never\nhaving dirty dishes, and having a planned menu for the week.\nWell Put Together: Consistent personal grooming, coordination in attire,\nand an overall polished appearance, including attention to details like\naccessories and makeup.

We would be able to measure each of these indicators on an ordinal\n1-5 scale, 5 being the most feminine, 1 being the least feminine.\nConsidering there is no true 0 in this, we would infer that this would be\nan interval level of measurement, because we are combining numerical\nrepresentation of my indicators and there are equal intervals between each\nnumerical number on our scale. To get the average score of someone's\nfemininity, I would multiply their score with the weight and total out\ntheir score after.

Each indicator stems from one of the dimensions that I mentioned, which includes appearance, mannerisms, and behaviors. Those are the two that I can think of right now. I asked myself about femininity in terms of appearance. I considered what I view as feminine, and I defined physical appearance in terms of body shape and size, grooming, and overall maintenance of the body, such as hair and nails. I feel these are all indicators of appearance.\n\nFor mannerisms and behavior, I again thought about what is considered feminine. I wrote down that being domestic is feminine, as well as being overall graceful and having gentle communication styles. I approached this top-down, starting from broad dimensions and simplifying them into specific indicators.\n\nI also discussed the validity and reliability of my approach based on my essay. I used content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity. These ensure that we are targeting the right concept, which is femininity, and that we are collecting data on this specific concept.\n\nFor reliability, I used the test-retest method and internal consistency. For the test-retest method, I noted that this might not be the most effective reliability test because a person's confidence could change throughout the day, potentially yielding different results. This variability could put the reliability of our measurement into question.

If you don't have enough variability, and you limit responses to a simple \"yes\" or \"no,\" someone might choose \"yes\" one day and \"no\" another day if they are ambivalent. \n\nHowever, if you provide a wider range of options, individuals can select more accurate representations of their feelings. This approach improves accuracy because people choose options they genuinely align with. Consequently, it also enhances reliability; repeated tests with the same person are more likely to yield consistent results if they have a broader spectrum of choices. When the options are limited to \"yes\" or \"no,\" the results can vary for people who are on the fence, leading to less reliable outcomes.

For criterion validity, I would compare my work to other studies in the same field, specifically those covering political participation. If my results are similar to theirs, it indicates that my test has some validity.

For instance, I would change one thing it recommended and send it back as my revised version.

Friendship involves shared emotions about outside factors, like other people, or movies, whether that be positive or negative. This helps reinforce the bond in a friendship. It involves trust, compassion, and love. Trust is believing someone to be reliable, which is the idea that someone is consistent. Consistent is when you are unchanging, you repeat the same steps as close as possible in both physical and emotional aspects. Consistency relates to dependability and emotional support over time. Compassion involves having emotional concern for others, or showing physical and mental emotions, like, emotional support towards events in their life, positive and negative. This can come in the form of giving advice, helping them, and caring for them when they are not well. Love involves emotional connection or attachment to the other person with a varying intensity.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOperationalization: Friendship is operationalized as a combination of trust, love, and compassion, each of which is measured using various indicators. Trust is measured by participants rating their comfort with the friend and reliability of the friend on a scale of 1 to 10, including a measure of how much they agreed with the statement 'My friend kept their promise' on a 7-point Likert scale. Love is assessed by measuring emotional closeness on a scale of 1 to 10 and the emotional significance of shared experiences. Compassion is measured by participants' responses to how often friends expressed concern and sympathy in difficult situations using a 7-point Likert scale, and on a scale from 1 to 10, responses are analyzed separately for each dimension to capture individual aspects of friendship or combined by averaging scores to generate an overall friendship score.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728597290663, "student": {"_id": "66f47b3ae801ab8eec57e309", "uid": "XSNwRcRGPubOX1pifENxvc7ZWV02", "email": "mgsk@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727298362196, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Max Sanchez", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

To be a good friend, you need to consistently show emotions like love, concern, compassion, and trust. I've explained this in all my conceptual definitions. \n\nWhen asked about the connection between consistency and dependability in forming a strong friendship, I believe that to be really close friends, you need to consistently support each other. For example, my best friend and I live together, so we see each other every day. We share emotions about various subjects and external factors. We know each other well, and we consistently talk to one another. Even when we're not living together, like during the summer or winter breaks, we make an effort to hang out. \n\nI can depend on him to help me if I need it, and he can depend on me in the same way. In terms of our friendship, we became close by consistently spending time with each other and working together. That's how we became best friends. To maintain this closeness, you have to consistently see and talk to each other. You also have to be able to depend on the other person. For example, in our household, I need to depend on him to clean up his part of the house and manage his responsibilities without me having to remind him. If I return home to find things unclean, I would question what's going on. Therefore, I trust him to handle these tasks.\n\nThat's why I believe consistency and dependability are essential for forming a strong friendship. Initially, you need consistency to grow the bond, and once that's established, you must be able to depend on each other. You need to stay consistent and depend on one another to maintain that closeness. That's essentially what I'm trying to convey."}, {"conversation_id": "67084845396a1f88fbc553f3", "question": "It's interesting how you relate daily interactions and shared responsibilities to forming closer bonds in friendships.

When we talk about positive emotions, we refer to experiences like having fun, joy, happiness, and cheerfulness. We enjoy watching TV shows together and find humor in them, and we also like going out, whether it's bowling or attending the Puyallup Fair. We've gone there multiple times with large groups of family and friends. These shared activities lead to shared emotions of enjoyment. We both have mutual interests, like soccer and sports, even if we don't support the same teams, and this is good for building our relationship. We always have something to talk about or do, which helps us deepen our friendship.\n\nIf we were to attend a football game together, our bond would grow even stronger because I don't just invite anyone to such events. I choose people who share my enthusiasm and will be just as passionate as I am as a fan. Negative emotions can also deepen a friendship, though sometimes they might strain it. We've gotten mad at each other before, and it did affect our friendship temporarily. However, in the end, we talked about it and grew closer. We understand that disagreements and anger are part of any relationship, and overcoming them strengthens our bond. \n\nHaving experienced negative emotions only once, we discussed it and became even better friends. These emotions helped us deepen our connection. Positive emotions enhance our understanding of each other and make our time together enjoyable. The more fun you have with someone, the more you want to spend time with them, and the more positive emotions you share, the closer you become.

It's like friendship can be measured on a Likert scale and a continuous scale based on three indicators: trust, love, and compassion. This allows for nuanced responses and potential grouping or individual analysis. I first came up with this definition when I was looking at my indicators. Obviously, I had to build my operational definition to measure the indicators, and when I was thinking about operationalization, it became clear that it's about measuring these indicators. It's akin to measuring friendship, where I had to define friendship through conceptualization, and then see that as the indicators. So, I built my operational definition based on the indicators I was using\u2014trust, love, and compassion. These are my three indicators that indicate how you know you have a good friendship or maybe a strong friendship.\n\nI also decided on the different scales on which the indicators would be measured. I didn't want to leave questions open for too many varied responses; I wanted it on a scale. Having it on a scale allows you to group together different numbers and conduct an analysis. For example, with a scale of one to seven, from strongly disagree to strongly agree, if two people choose \"strongly agree,\" you can say that their friendships are very similar. Not necessarily identical, but indicating a similar level of strength in their feelings toward each other. \n\nRegarding how I ensured the validity and reliability of these measures: the measures I used were interval and ordinal. Love has both interval and ordinal, where ordinal is a scale of one to ten, with one being not significant and ten being very significant. Interval, on a scale of one to seven, from strongly agree to strongly disagree, reflects emotional closeness to a friend. Compassion and trust were both measured at the interval level, also using a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree.\n\nThese methods helped ensure the validity and reliability of my measures. Validity makes sure that the measures are appropriate, accurately capturing the concept. Reliability ensures that the methods are consistent. I examined face validity, criterion validity, and content validity. Each of these aspects helps confirm that the measures are correct and provide accurate results, which is essential when ensuring you are measuring the right things."}, {"conversation_id": "67084845396a1f88fbc553f3", "question": "You did a great job explaining how you used scales to measure friendship!

Nonetheless, when I was asked to explain the three different types of validity, I discussed face validity, criterion-related validity, and content validity.\n\nI used content validity, which refers to the degree to which the full range of meanings and concepts is reflected in the measurement and its components. This ensures that all indicators are important and necessary for defining friendship. It is crucial that these indicators are included to confirm that we are using content validity to ensure our findings are accurate.\n\nFor criterion-related validity, it measures whether a variable logically correlates with another variable outside the study. In this context, I would measure their friendship along with their love of different types of food to see if they have similar interests, which makes sense, I hope.\n\nLastly, I discussed face validity, which is the degree to which the measurement reflects a common understanding of the concept. For my indicators, I would determine if the answers they have provided relate to different aspects of friendship. For the numerical data, it was important to ensure that the final numbers relate meaningfully to each other so that others could understand the strength of their friendship on a scale simply by looking at the numbers.\n\nSo, that's my explanation."}, {"conversation_id": "67084845396a1f88fbc553f3", "question": "You've done a great job detailing the validities in your essay.

Dr. Pierce mentioned in his lecture that the chatbot is designed to respond as they or Tatiana, the TA, would respond to our questions. So, it was essentially like having a teacher available for the entire assignment process. Moreover, having the opportunity to make revisions was beneficial because it assured me that I was progressing toward a correct definition that would earn more points for the assignment. I am hopeful I'm getting more points on this assignment.\n\nAs for the feedback on using a chatbot to refine my conceptual and operational definitions, as I mentioned before, I really enjoyed it. I found it beneficial because it provided immediate responses. I could input my question or definition and receive detailed feedback within thirty seconds. This allowed me to review the feedback instead of just listening and trying to remember everything.\n\nRegarding how this might influence my understanding and measurement of friendship, as I mentioned previously, it helped me see that friendship is deeper than just having mutual feelings for someone, as mutual feelings can be vague and broad. For instance, I can have mutual feelings of dislike toward someone. Initially, I considered mutual positive feelings, but even that could imply mutual romantic love rather than friendship.\n\nUsing the chatbot helped me narrow down what friendship entails, beyond just positive mutual feelings. It helped me focus on trust, love, and compassion. For example, my mom shows me compassion, but she's not my friend. Similarly, I share a non-romantic love with my best friend, and understanding this distinction was crucial.\n\nIn conclusion, the chatbot was instrumental in refining my definition of friendship. It helped me understand that friendship is conceptually and operationally more specific than I initially thought. It encouraged me to be more precise and avoid broad terms, requiring definitions for any new terms introduced. Overall, I found the experience very beneficial."}]}, "670864f5396a1f88fbc56ed8": {"_id": "670864f5396a1f88fbc56ed8", "created_at": 1728603381490, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "1. Final Conceptualization:\n\nTrauma refers to the lasting and detrimental effect that remains with the body and mind of a human being after a certain harmful event or period of time. Trauma has dimensions which include different properties that make it distinctive from emotions such as fear or sadness, or disorders such as depression or anxiety that may produce a similar effect. However these are different from trauma, because the symptoms can come and go, whereas the effects of trauma continually affect the person\u2019s relationships, career, and self-perception, which continues throughout their lives as a continuous link to the origin, creating a distinctive type of persistence. Furthermore, emotions such as fear or sadness are states of mind that change day to day, whereas trauma is continual, though it can vary in intensity based on certain triggers or life events that remind them of the origin. Distinctive properties include this origin (which refers to the event or period of time that left the person physically harmed, made them experience an emotion such as terror that they could never forget due to its intensity, which can leave a permanent mark on one\u2019s brain, or left them emotionally harmed from watching the suffering or terror of others, and this has a direct link to the continual effects left behind), persistency (meaning that the effects are continuous and consistent, meaning that the effects are continually present in the person in everyday interactions with people and places, though they can vary in intensity, meaning that the person can never forget their trauma or leave it in the past), and predominance (meaning that the effects dominate the person's mind and actions, making it difficult to live a normal life, this directly affects their decision-making skills and life outlook, they will value protecting themselves over beneficial decisions such as a new job or meeting new people and most people or places are seen as a threat to themselves as an emotional response tied to safety concerns, making it difficult to see the world as good or kind). Trauma also produces behaviors such as avoidance (referring to the person's avoiding of people, settings, or things, a behavior developed by the constant reminder of their trauma, even if that avoidance negatively affects their social or professional life, such as the removal of a close friend or family from their life, or removing themselves from their workplace and losing their job purely to avoid any reminder of the trauma they\u2019ve experienced) and self-sabotage (meaning that after the experience of the origin of trauma that the person has experienced, they think that they are undeserving of good or kind things and makes decisions that could be harmful to themselves, such as isolating themselves or beginning unhealthy relationships, relationships that cause the person unnecessary grief, stress, or pain, that directly physically or emotionally harm them, which can manifest as emotional (manipulating one\u2019s emotions, making them feel like their feelings don\u2019t matter), verbal (insulting and demeaning a person), or physical abuse (physically hitting a person)\n\n2.

I would assign each question a specific number that would be totaled at the end to find the average number that represented the concept of trauma in my research. In the list answer choices such as number 3 in the origin dimension, each choice would have a certain number assigned to it be added up at the end of the survey, for example grief being worth 2, and anything not selected being worth 0. Each question would be assigned a different number based on the evidence it provided and the open ended questions would be there for extra information. Indicators that asked for agree or disagree answers would be rated with ascending points leading up to strongly agree to be totaled up at the end to find the average and compare the effects of trauma in the participants. Which will be a ratio measurement.\n\n4. This research would be conducted as a survey, conducted amongst a target population of people who had experienced significant trauma to evaluate the effects. The participants would be encouraged to be completely honest and assured that their answers would be anonymous to encourage complete honesty. A researcher would need to consider that a population of people who have experienced trauma may not be easily incentivized to take the survey and may be emotionally affected after taking it. The research would require counseling offered to the participants if needed and as an incentive, also ensuring beneficence, that the people suffering from these effects could be helped.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728604071894, "student": {"_id": "66f74821cfeaac6b6ec098cb", "uid": "CJ2ZwCXT1hXpWbA48M9iorZmOWo2", "email": "gmcman3@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727481889435, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Georgia McManigle", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

For example, for the character dimension, I considered using terms like morals and ethics, even though I didn't include them in the definition of pride. I tried to create questions that would be more palatable for participants to answer and then related these responses to my overall definition of pride.\n\nRegarding the validity and reliability of the research as a whole, I feel that many of the questions are interconnected and correlated, so the answers should generally be similar. I used scales, such as one-to-ten, one-to-seven, or one-to-five, ensuring that all lower points represented one aspect (e.g., less prideful), while higher points represented another (e.g., more prideful).

Obviously, not everyone is like that, and it is a bit of a stereotype. However, I feel that except for the very oldest generation, many teens through middle-aged individuals may feel similarly about their character and identity.

Stress can be a physical, mental, and emotional tension that people feel when dealing with a situation that is uncomfortable or overwhelming. Physical tension can be something like a headache, or when someone starts to do an action like shake their leg due to social, academic, or professional situations that this person is not able to find ways to cope with. Emotional tension refers to how someone feels when dealing with stress. In other words, stress can make someone feel sad or angry and correlate with other feelings of worry. Mental tension refers to how someone might think or process information when stressed. For example, these people might have a harder time concentrating or understanding information. These situations can range from work related environments, to personal. Possibly dealing with conflicts between friendships or other relationships can be the reason for a situation being uncomfortable. Having a lack of control or being put in a position where someone might not have the right answer could be uncomfortable. Receiving a bad grade in a class or having an upcoming exam can make someone feel overwhelmed due to the amount of simultaneous demands. It is good to note that small amounts of stress, like an upcoming exam, can be beneficial for us because it can serve as a motivator to get stuff done. For example, if someone is stressed about an upcoming exam, it can push that person to study extra hard. To tell when stress is beneficial, it depends on the situation and how intensely the individual is feeling stressed. In other words, if this individual develops coping mechanisms or is generally a resilient person, then there might not be many situations that are deemed negative. If the situation is an upcoming exam, but this individual has a known history of being an anxious test taker, this might not be a beneficial stress situation, but instead a situation that could impact their physical, mental, or emotional state mentioned earlier. \n2. \"For upcoming exams I study ahead of time\" (academic) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"Very Strongly Disagree\" to \"Very Strongly Agree\"\n- level of measurement for this indicator is interval\n\"If I am in a disagreement with a friend, I overthink my responses\" (social) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"Very Strongly Disagree\" to \"Very Strongly Agree\"\n- level of measurement for this indicator is interval\n\"I am confident when interviewing for a new job position\" (professional) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"Very Strongly Disagree\" to \"Very Strongly Agree\"\n- level of measurement for this indicator is interval\n\"When I feel overwhelmed, I struggle concentrating on one thing at a time\" (mental) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"Very Strongly Disagree\" to \"Very Strongly Agree\"\n- level of measurement for this indicator is interval\n\"I shake my leg when feeling stressed\" (physical) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"Very Strongly Disagree\" to \"Very Strongly Agree\"\n- level of measurement for this indicator is interval\n\"When I feel stressed I tend to lash out angrily\" (emotional) -  Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"Very Strongly Disagree\" to \"Very Strongly Agree\"\n- level of measurement for this indicator is interval\n\"I came up with my own ways to deal with stress\" (coping mechanism/resilience) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \"Very Strongly Disagree\" to \"Very Strongly Agree\"\n- level of measurement for this indicator is interval\n3. I will add them up. There are 7. Each will be weighted the same. The level of measurement of the combined numerical representation is nominal.\n4. This would be a survey targeted towards college students. So, ages (19-23). The participants would be told that this survey is completely confidential, and that they simply must go through the questions and choose whichever answers represent them the best. They would be told briefly that this survey is about the concept of stress and the reason I would target college students is because of the age group = young adults, when social, professional, and academic indicators are still all very present. \n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728612180305, "student": {"_id": "6700dfeae801ab8eec57e7ee", "uid": "ANfWC0L7BiT0k5f0E8ou4RzdbhB3", "email": "emmak123@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1728110570376, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Emma Kim", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Stress is the body\u2019s natural reaction to a challenge (a situation requiring effort to overcome) or a threat (a person, event, or condition posing harm or danger), whether real or perceived. This response involves both physiological reactions\u2014automatic bodily processes like increased heart rate, muscle tension, and heightened alertness, which are part of the body\u2019s fight-or-flight response\u2014and emotional reactions, such as anxiety, frustration, fear, or anger. While these reactions often occur together, they can also happen independently. For example, someone might experience physical symptoms of stress without realizing they\u2019re emotionally distressed, or they may feel emotionally overwhelmed without obvious physical symptoms. Stress can be triggered by external factors (e.g., work pressures, relationship conflicts), which come from the environment, and internal factors (e.g., negative thoughts, worries, or personal beliefs), which originate within the mind. External stressors typically cause more immediate responses, while internal stressors may build up gradually over time, intensifying as individuals dwell on them. Not all stress is negative. Adaptive stress helps individuals adjust to new situations, maintain focus, and stay motivated to overcome challenges. The degree to which stress is adaptive varies depending on the person and the situation. For instance, some may find a certain level of stress energizing, while others may feel overwhelmed in the same circumstances. The shift from adaptive to overwhelming stress depends on both subjective perceptions (how capable someone feels of managing stress) and measurable indicators, such as chronic physical symptoms (e.g., fatigue or muscle tension) or psychological signs (e.g., persistent anxiety or burnout). \n2. \nPhysiological Reaction: Increased heart rate (measured in beats per minute). Participants will wear a heart rate monitor (e.g., smartwatch) to continuously measure heart rate during specific stress-inducing tasks (e.g., public speaking, timed exams, or high-pressure problem-solving). These tasks will be uniformly stressful across participants to ensure consistency.\nEmotional Reaction: Anxiety level (measured on a 0-100 scale). A self-report questionnaire will be used to measure participants' anxiety levels in response to stress. Participants will rate their anxiety using a 0-100 scale where 0 represents \"No anxiety\" and 100 represents \"Extreme anxiety.\" \u201cIn the last month, how anxious have you felt during stressful situations.\u201d\nAdaptive Stress: Motivation level (measured on a 0-100 scale). A self-report questionnaire will assess how stress influences participants' motivation to perform better. Participants will rate their motivation on a 0-100, where 0 represents \"Not motivated at all\" and 100 represents \"Extremely motivated.\" \u201cWhen faced with a stressful situation, how much does it motivate you to work harder?\u201d\nOverwhelming Stress: Fatigue level (measured on a 0-100 scale). A self-report questionnaire will assess the level of physical exhaustion caused by stress. Participants will rate their fatigue on a 0-100, where 0 represents \"Not exhausted at all\" and 100 represents \"Extremely exhausted.\u201d \u201cIn the last month, how physically exhausted have you felt due to stress?\u201d\n3. To combine my indicators into a single numerical representation of stress, I plan to average them. I will take the scores for heart-rate (physiological reaction), anxiety (emotional reaction, motivation (adaptive stress), and fatigue (overwhelming stress) and average them to create one overall stress score. I wouldn\u2019t give any indictor more weight than the others because each one is equally important in measuring stress. Since heart rate in beats per minute (ratio level) and the other indictors are on a 0-100 scale (interval level), averaging them will result in a combined interval level of measurement. After averaging, the final score won\u2019t have a true zero point, which is a characteristic of interval data like I described in the previous question. \n4. To use these indicators, a researcher would likely combine a survey and an experiment to gather data. For a survey, it would be used to measure the latent constructs of emotional reactions (anxiety), adaptive stress (motivation), and overwhelming stress (fatigue). These variables are not directly observable, so the survey would include closed-ended questions with 0-100 scales to capture participants self-reported experiences. Then, the experiment would measure the manifest construct of physiological stress, specifically heart rate, which is directly observable. During a controlled stress-inducing tasks, like public speaking or a timed exam, participants heart rate would be monitored using a wearable device to collect continuous data. The target population could be adults aged 18-65 who experience stress regularly, such as students or working professionals. The population would need to be diverse enough to allow for generalizations but should also be accessible based on the research goals. Now, when it comes to instructions, participants would be told, \u201cPlease complete the following questions about your stress levels over the past month. Use the scale from 0 to 100, where \u201c0\u201d means \u201cnot at all\u201d and \u201c100\u201d means \u201cextremely\u201d. Please answer each question based on how you\u2019ve felt in the last month.\u201d I feel that these instructions will guide participants in providing responses for anxiety, motivation, and fatigue, allowing the researcher to gather observable indicators of these dimensions of stress.\n\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728614504605, "student": {"_id": "67088c7eb87729d138f3c579", "uid": "Vbn3TnWcTCQxy9WtcM5y1J4MRIh1", "email": "alaynalawe@gmail.com", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1728613502972, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Alayna Galfo", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

It was challenging because I didn\u2019t want too many subcategories within the concept; I wanted it to be broad, but not too specific. I think that physiological responses like increased heart rate and heightened alertness are the most common experiences people have when stressed. Additionally, emotional reactions, which are also common, reflect how you feel when you're stressed. That's why I chose to focus on these two aspects.

Elements of social identity vary with the individual. One element includes culture, which are the social norms, behaviors, and beliefs which influence the individuals upbringing. Another element is the race of an individual, which is the physical appearance of an individual based on skin color or in some cases the country/general area one is from. Another element is ethnicity, which is the origin of an individual, generally based on shared cultural heritage and ancestry. Another element is sexuality, which is the individuals sexual orientation and sexual identity. Sexual orientation is the way in which one expresses their sexual attraction(e.g. same-sex, opposite-sex). Sexual identity is the labels used to express their attraction to other people( e.g. gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, etc.) Gender is also an element of social identity, which includes sex and gender identity. Sex is the gender assigned at birth(e.g. male or female), which is a biological construct of gender. Gender identity is the gender one expresses themselves as(e.g. male, female, transgender, non-binary), which is the social construct of gender. These elements create individuality, however there are levels of commonality which can create social groups, with the societal interactions being formed through the excitement of commonality through self-identifying social factors. \u00a0\n\nFinal Operationalization Definition:\u00a0\n\nContext: Participants ages 18-25 will participate in this anonymous survey to determine what indicators influence their social identity the most.

Ex: I label myself as a gay man which strongly influences my social identity.\n\nOn a scale 1 to 10 how do my cultural practices or traditions influence my social identity?(1 being the least influential 10 being the most) Ex: I grew up practicing Islam which is a strong part of my identity.\n\nOn a scale 1 to 10 how do my religious practices influence my social identity?(1 being the least influential 10 being the most) Ex: I grew up practicing Islam which is a strong part of my identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728615032638, "student": {"_id": "66f7640ce801ab8eec57e44b", "uid": "BqOXPkZWNpXk1aFjIoxZDqp25wk1", "email": "krislk04@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727489036582, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Kristina Kaminska", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Levels of the presence of each of the feelings (disappointment, depression, anxiety, and insecurity) individually may vary - but the presence of each - except depression - is required to some extent. Depression is not a mandatory dimension, as it is a more extreme manifestation of body Image dissatisfaction and may not be present in all cases. In this case, how one perceives their body refers to how negatively or positively an individual feels about their body as a whole - intrinsically -  and also when impacted by external factors. The gauge of how one perceives their body is meant to be all encompassing - regardless of whether the reasons they are feeling these are their own ruminations or external reasons such as shifting societal body standards (implied or directly stated messaging in any form of current \u201ctrends\u201d in features and functionalities of facets of the body); it is about the feeling not what causes it. The presence of these factors (such as societal body standards) may impact certain dimensions more than others, though this is not necessary. For example, external factors such as societal body standards may impact anxiety more than disappointment, as an individual may feel more pressure to conform to those standards than disappointment that they are not conforming. This perception includes not only perception about appearance but also about the functionality of their body. All of the dimensions can be impacted by both or either functionality or appearance to differing degrees and none are definitively more or less connected to any factors that can influence disappointment, depression, anxiety, and insecurity. Disappointment in this case refers to a sense of sadness regarding how an individual views their own body on an aesthetic and functional level (both on how their body simply looks and how it performs. Depression refers to a sense of lack of interest and profound sadness that interferes with day to day life as a result of an individual's feelings regarding the appearance or functionality of their body (this sense of depression can stem from either or both appearance and functionality). This sense of depression may manifest as depression manifests traditionally, the distinguishing factor here would be that it is seen as manifesting because of dissatisfaction with body image. Anxiety in this case refers to a sense of stress around how your body or facets/features of your body appear and function - and how that is received by you and those around you. Insecurity refers to a sense of shame regarding how your body or facets/features of your body function and appear. Anxiety and insecurity are primarily different because anxiety is associated with a sense of stress - a sense of pressure to conform - whereas, insecurity is associated with a sense of shame around not confirming (so the pressure of change versus the result of not being able to conform to the standard). Any and all of these can be influenced by the factors that cause body dissatisfaction, it is on a personal level to what degree one factor may impact one dimension more than others - so that is irrelevant to the purposes of this study. \noperational definition: \n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you discuss (speak out loud with any person) feeling sad about parts of your body, either how they work or how they look [disappointment] \n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you feel sad about parts of your body, either how they work or how they look [disappointment]\n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you feel deeply sad on a regular and persistent basis - to the extent that it impacts your daily life -  because of your dissatisfaction with how your body looks or functions [depression]\n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you discuss (speak out loud with any person) feeling stressed about how your body looks or functions [anxiety]\n- how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you feel stressed about how your body looks or functions [anxiety]\n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you feel a pressure to change how your body looks or functions [anxiety]\n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you feel stressed about judgment by others because your body doesn't look or perform a certain way [anxiety]\n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you discuss (speak out loud with any person) feeling ashamed because of how your body looks or functions [insecurity]\n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you feel ashamed because of how your body looks or functions [insecurity] \n-how frequently (on a scale of not often at all to very often) do you feel pressure to hide parts of yourself because of how your body looks or functions [insecurity]\n\n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728615525895, "student": {"_id": "66f6ff65cfeaac6b6ec098a6", "uid": "Y2f9b0jdYfRDfHnDmekvCT8sEx53", "email": "amehta6@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727463269337, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Ananya Mehta ", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

I was anxious and felt compelled to finish it. My anxiety and stress pushed me to complete the assignment. However, there's a very thin line between healthy and unhealthy anxiety. That distinction inspired me to discuss anxiety and insecurity.\n\nInsecurity is a commonly discussed topic, especially concerning body image. People often feel insecure about various aspects of themselves. Anxiety also came to mind because it's another form of pressure. Pressure exists everywhere, and body dissatisfaction isn't immune to the anxiety that permeates many areas of our lives.\n\nI wanted to explore this because I think insecurity is a prevalent issue and often results from body image dissatisfaction. Anxiety, on the other hand, feels like part of the process\u2014the pressure you feel leads to anxiety, which is the end result and a way to verbalize that pressure.\n\nWriting this essay affected my perspective. I had to think critically about how I define anxiety versus insecurity versus depression and other emotions.

As I mentioned, anxiety is often discussed, but perhaps not specifically in terms of body image. I want to explore how body image has evolved, particularly with the rise of social media. It seems like body types have become trends that come and go. A significant aspect of this trend is similar to when a purse becomes popular, and suddenly, everyone feels the pressure, stress, and anxiety to acquire it. It's reminiscent of when you were a kid and wanted a trending toy. For example, there were stuffed animals called Beanie Boo Babies that were popular when I was in fifth grade. That was the must-have item, and there was a childish version of anxiety or stress to obtain it. If you couldn't get it, there was a sense of disappointment.\n\nI've thought about the dimensions of anxiety and disappointment as two opposite ends of the spectrum. Anxiety is the stress you feel reaching for that item, while disappointment is the feeling when you can't get it. I believe that external factors might impact anxiety more than disappointment. This is because trends in appearance, such as which hair color or nose shape is popular, can contribute significantly to anxiety. These trends come and go like a fad, similar to how clothing trends used to be. Now, trends apply to body features, and that could be more associated with anxiety because you are trying to change something personal and it's already fleeting. It becomes more of a long-term goal that you\u2019re unable to achieve, leading to feelings of sadness."}, {"conversation_id": "67089136396a1f88fbc593f5", "question": "It's interesting how you compared body trends to childhood trends like toys.

That's a surgery you have to undergo, and I think that absolutely affects long-term body dissatisfaction.

I believe that's how I maintain both reliability and validity. Reliability is primarily achieved by maintaining consistency in my phrasing so that responses remain consistent. As for validity, it involves ensuring that the language used in my conceptualization carries over to the operationalization. I determine which specific nuances from my conceptualization are essential to include in my operationalization by focusing on those that are integral to conveying the question and capturing the concept clearly.\n\nFor example, as I mentioned earlier, I clarified what it meant to \"discuss\" because \"discuss\" is a very formal word. Some people might interpret it as needing a formal conversation rather than an offhand remark to a friend. I wanted to make it clear that when I said \"discuss,\" it referred to any instance where someone spoke out loud about a feeling.

However, a chatbot doesn't tire and continues to push limits that you might not usually reach with another individual. The only challenge I can foresee is that it lacks the emotional component. For example, when discussing emotions like anxiety or disappointment, I don't think it can provide feedback in the same way a human could. But I don't see this as a significant issue as long as you're prepared to account for it ahead of time and understand that you need to compensate for the fact that the chatbot can't assist with inherently human characteristics."}]}, "670891c6396a1f88fbc59499": {"_id": "670891c6396a1f88fbc59499", "created_at": 1728614854239, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "Final conceptual definition: Courage is the capacity to remain resilient during periods of emotional, physical, or situational adversity and to take action in the face of personal fears. This involves confronting challenges rather than avoiding them regardless of whether they are emotional physical or social difficulties. The first dimension, solitude refers to the ability to think independently and resist the pressure to conform to prevailing opinions or societal norms. This can manifest both mentally maintaining your own beliefs and decisions in the face of opposition and physically choosing actions that may go against the crowd or social and emotional comfort. The second dimension, speaking up, involves taking action when witnessing something morally wrong or unjust. This might be uncomfortable confrontations, whether it is through verbal advocacy or other actions and is essential for demonstrating moral courage.\nFinal set of indicators and associated level of measurement: \u201cI often speak my mind even when others disagree or have other ideas\u201d (Speaking up)\n\u201cWhen I see wrongdoing I call it out\u201d (Speaking up)\n\u201cWhen I see others being treated unfairly I stand up for them\u201d (Speaking up)\n\u201cI stay true to my beliefs and ideas regardless of what others think\u201d (Solitude)\n\u201cI resist pressure from family or friends when making decisions or forming opinions\u201d (Solitude) \nParticipants will respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree\u201d for each question.\nAll of these fall under the categorical variable level of measurement.\nHow you are going to combine those indicators and what the level of measurement of the combined numerical representation will be: My plan too combine my indicators will be to assign a number to each level of measurement so that very strongly disagree is 1 point all the way up to 7 points, then find the average of their answers and that will be the representation. All questions will way the same as I think they all are worth an equal value. The level of measurement will be similar as each individual question. By adding the averages we will know if their actions very strongly don\u2019t align to each dimension all the way to very strongly align. The combination will still be a categorical variable level of measurement that each person will fall into.\nThe procedures for applying these indicators for data collection: For our data collection process we want to give our survey out to college kids and allow them to give back their answers anonymously to allow for the truest response. This demographic makes sense because college students are often put in situations where their courage is put on display weather in the classroom or outside of it. The survey would be simple to administer as many students have taken similar surveys for other subjects, so their wouldn\u2019t need to be much instructions given.

There are many factors that perpetuate stereotypes such as the media, neighborhood, peers, and institutions) assigned to their given race (a socially constructed grouping and social ranking of individuals based on the color of their skin and perceived shared traits such as speech, mannerisms, and cultural practices), ethnicity (the categorization of one\u2019s shared language, ancestry, and cultural values that can contain multiple ethnic categorizations based on multifaceted ethnic identities. The intersection of multiple ethnic identities can cause one to face the barriers and benefits that are associated with their different identities), or culture (a culmination of factors and practices that a certain group of people with underlying values, beliefs, and behaviors share. These values, beliefs, and behaviors can shift over time as external factors such as the media, institutions, and new ideals change.)\n\nOperational: A microaggression is a statement or action, verbal or non-verbal, that an individual takes to intentionally or unintentionally target a marginalized group based on stereotypes assigned to race, ethnicity, or culture.\nMeasurement for\n intentionality and intentionality: \nIndicator 1: \n\u201cIn the last month, how many times have you made statements about someone\u2019s race, ethnicity, or culture that you believed were intentional?\u201d (1=never, 2=1-3 times, 3=4-6 times, 4=7-9 times, 5=10+ times)\n\u201cIn the last month, how many times have you made statements about someone\u2019s race, ethnicity, or culture that you believed were unintentional?\u201d (1=never, 2=1-3 times, 3=4-6 times, 4=7-9 times, 5=10+ times)\nIndicator 2: \u201cHow often do you reflect and realize you may have offended someone based on their race/ethnicity/culture?\u201d (1=never, 5=often)\n\"Can you describe a specific instance where you realized you offended someone based on their race/ethnicity/culture?\"\nImpact of marginalized groups: \nIndicator 1 \"How often do you feel excluded from social settings based on your race, ethnicity, or culture?\"(1=never, 5=always)\nIndicator 2: \"Have you experienced being denied opportunities (e.g., job offers, promotions) based on your racial/ethnic background?\" (yes or no)\n\u201cIf yes, how often have you been denied opportunities based on your racial/ethnic background?\u201d (1=rarely, 5=always)\n\u201cIf yes, how did you know you were being denied because of your race?\u201d\nStereotypes: \n\"How often do you hear statements that generalize your race/ethnicity, such as 'You're good at sports because you're [racial group]'?\" (1=never, 5=always)\n\"How often do you encounter positive stereotypes (e.g., 'All Asians are good at math')?\nHow often do you encounter negative stereotypes (e.g., 'People from [group] are lazy')?\" (1=never, 5=always)\nRace, ethnicity, culture: \n\"Have you experienced offensive comments or actions based on your physical appearance (skin color, facial features) or the way you speak?\" (yes or no. If so, on a scale 1-5 how often? 1=never, 5=always)\n\"If you have multiple ethnic identities, how often do you feel that these identities affect how people treat you (positively or negatively)?\" (1=never, 5=very often)\nIf so, what are the different ethnic identities you possess?\nwhat comments are made about your different ethnicities (e.g.: \u201cyou must be good at school because you\u2019re asian\u201d, \u201cyou must be really feisty because you\u2019re Latina\u201d)? \n\"How often do people make assumptions about your food preferences based on your cultural background?\" (1=never, 5=very often)\n\"How often do people make assumptions about other aspects of your cultural background (e.g., language, customs) based on stereotypes?\" (1=never, 5=very often)\n\nIn this operational definition, the use of continuous measurements will be the most helpful. However, I will start by asking what race, ethnicity, cultural values, level of education, gender, and socioeconomic status the respondent belongs to. This will be a fill in section, so participants can self identify, minimizing exclusion. Incorporating gender, level of education, and socioeconomic status will allow me to control for race, ethnicity, and cultural values. In addition, it will allow me to observe the intersectionality of the respondents. This first question will be nominal, as these are concrete answers. I will use the results from these surveys to average out the responses and correlate the findings to the act of verbal and nonverbal microaggressions. The use of interval, especially the likert scale is the most beneficial when having people take this self-reported survey. To make sense of these results, for each measurable dimension, I will break up the respondents\u2019 answers by race, as people typically make microaggressions on external features.  In these racialized groups, I will look at the respondent\u2019s answers to the Likert scale survey and average out my findings for each measurable dimension such as intentionality vs unintentionality, marginalization, stereotypes, and race, ethnicity, and culture. Once I find the averaged numbers for each dimension of each race, I will compare and contrast the numbers to conclude which racial groups are more susceptible to receiving microaggressions. I will also be able to see the correlation between the different dimensions. I will be able to see that higher marginalized groups tend to belong to lower SES backgrounds, living in lower class housing and restritcing their access to education, and experience more stereotypes and therefore, more microaggressions. While I could also measure which racial groups are more likely to give microaggressions, I believe the results will not be fully comprehensive. As seen in the lecture videos, people tend to answer surveys in a more positive and optimistic light; therefore, I believe many people, especially White people, will not admit or minimize the microaggressions they give. Additionally, I believe generalizing a race to being more or less prone to giving microaggressions is not accurate; rather, it is a more individualistic concept. \nUltimately, this self reported survey covers the different facets and dimensions of microaggressions. It allows verbal and non verbal microaggressions to be studied, the impact of marginalization of minority groups, how different stereotypes are prevalent, and how people\u2019s race, ethnicity, and culture contribute to their susceptibility of receiving microaggressions. The use of continuous levels of measurement, mainly the Likert scale will provide me with the most conclusive results that I will be able to analyze. \n", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728615778060, "student": {"_id": "66f5ff1be801ab8eec57e381", "uid": "yBhtpeUvJebjK62W0ptwrcph7gz2", "email": "twong20@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727397659759, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Taylor Wong", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Instead, they can arise due to various factors such as upbringing, background, education level, and the social circles one is part of, where microaggressions may be common.\n\nIn contrast, there are also intentional microaggressions.

Looking back at the history of those in lower socioeconomic classes, we see a correlation between level of education and access to resources. Living in lower socioeconomic households and communities often means having less public funding and access to quality education.\n\nThis lack of education can lead to a decreased awareness or sensitivity towards microaggressions.

These can include the individual being prone to overthinking, which is definable as the act of thinking more than necessary or beyond the confines of reason for one topic; mentally shutting down, which refers to when an individual is disconnected from themself and their emotions as a defense mechanism; and an inability to focus on other topics of conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel nauseous when stressed\u201d (Physical manifestation of stress) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree.\u201d\nThe level of measurement for this indicator is Ordinal as the variables are categorized/labeled, and are ranked in a specific order\n\u201cI often find myself/experience sweating more than usual when stressed\u201d (Physical manifestation of stress) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree.\u201d\nThe level of measurement for this indicator is Ordinal as the variables are categorized/labeled, and are ranked in a specific order\n\u201cI find it difficult to take in full breaths when stressed\u201d (Physical manifestation of stress) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree.\u201d\u00a0\nThe level of measurement for this indicator is Ordinal as the variables are categorized/labeled, and are ranked in a specific order\n\u201cI find myself wanting to eat more than my usual quantity\u201d (Physical manifestation of stress) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree.\u201d\nThe level of measurement for this indicator is Ordinal as the variables are categorized/labeled, and are ranked in a specific order\n\u201cI think about the same problem or situation for extended periods of time, going over the same instances multiple times\u201d (Internal manifestation of stress) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree.\u201d\nThe level of measurement for this indicator is Ordinal as the variables are categorized/labeled, and are ranked in a specific order\n\u201cI feel disconnected from myself or my emotions after facing a triggering or high-stress situation/experience\u201d (Internal manifestation of stress) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree.\u201d\nThe level of measurement for this indicator is Ordinal as the variables are categorized/labeled, and are ranked in a specific order\n\"I find it difficult to focus on the present after facing a stressful situation/event\" (Internal manifestation of stress) - Participants respond on a 7-point scale from \u201cVery Strongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cVery Strongly Agree.\u201d\nThe level of measurement for this indicator is Ordinal as the variables are categorized/labeled, and are ranked in a specific order\n\n\n\n\nThere are 7 indicators in total, so I will combine my indicators by adding all 7 of them up to represent a single numerical representation. No indicator should be \"weighted\" more in the score as they are all points that equally represent my concept, which is \"stress.\" I prefer adding the indicators because it demonstrates how each indicator is of equal value, thus when added all up represents the concept well. Different individuals would experience stress in different manner, therefore, by not placing more value on a specific indicator, it ensures that empirical indicators can be more holistic and cover a wider range of people. Since the level of measurement for all the indicators is ordinal, when the numbers are added and combined the level of measurement becomes\u00a0interval.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAs the researcher, I would give an online survey to my participants. My target population will be university students in urban settings/environments, from both public and private institutes.

However, I will recruit people to stand in different locations of the university, so as to not have an unknown bias of the types of participants that frequent specific areas of the university more than others. (What this means is, if it is convenient to find participants at the library, it could hinder the reliability of the scores as it could be noted that individuals at the library may be more stressed, hence being there to study, etc.) As part of the informed consent process, participants will be told beforehand that the survey is confidential.

I believe it measures stress accurately because when people reflect on their emotions, it can be challenging to measure how they are feeling. With various indicators, it becomes easier for someone to determine their feelings at that moment and place themselves within the scale. This is more effective than having indicators that merely ask questions, such as \"How are you?\" or statements like \"I often find it difficult to take in full breaths\" as a reaction to stress.

Conversely, if someone else consistently chooses the lowest option on the scale, their score would be seven, assuming there are seven indicators. This method ensures consistency across all participants because the final number reflects their answers, as opposed to a simpler yes-or-no format.

Workplace diversity creates an inclusive (everyone is welcomed and valued) and varying (there is a difference from person to person) environment. Dimensions of this concept are differences in gender identity, education level, racial/ethnic background, age, and personality type. Gender identity in the workplace means the gender a worker presents as (woman, man, non-binary, etc.) and that there are protections (policies/workplace norms as well as expression and experience protections) for everyone no matter how they identify. Education level in the workplace can be defined by degree level (or no degree if the job doesn't require one), institution (high school, college, or other), and areas of study (majors and minors) and making sure that there is no discrimination based upon this (also ensuring that hierarchies are based on performance, not education level [ex: fair chances at promotions for everyone, despite education level]). Racial and ethnic background in the workplace means the inclusion of people that have different backgrounds from the majority population in the workplace (for many work environments the majority would be white) and everyone should be protected (policies/workplace norms). Racial/ethnic background diversity promotes representation (anyone would be able to find someone who looks like them in multiple positions within the work hierarchy). This, like any diversity, encourages a broader expansion of ideas and viewpoints. Age diversity means that one age group is not overrepresented and a wide range of ages encourages different knowledge, ideas, and values (someone should also be able to find people their age in multiple positions within the work hierarchy). Lastly, personality type in this study will be defined as introversion (stereotypically more reserved and better at certain jobs than others) and extroversion (stereotypically more outgoing and better at certain jobs than others). While personality types are usually not a box that fits everyone, in terms of this study we will be focused on either introversion or extroversion as the two far sides of our spectrum. Making sure there is a wide range of personalities promotes creativity and teamwork.\n\n2.\u00a0\n\nPlease answer how strongly you agree with the following statement: I feel comfortable presenting as my desired gender around my coworkers.

For almost all of the indicators, I will be finding an average and using that. Because this study is about diversity, the main goal is just to find out if there is or isn't diversity within each of the dimensions. The only dimension I would be careful to look at is racial/ethnic background because one of the indicators for this asks if you work with people of the same race. This can get complicated if everyone is the same race or, for example, only works with different races despite the same races being in the company. So overall, an average would be the best means, however, more information (such as demographics) will most likely be needed to really weigh the importance of each dimension. The final level of measurement will be interval for all of the questions that do not have a defined zero and ratio for those that do.\n\n4. This would be given in a survey.

Fair in this sense means that everyone is sharing both the risks of an action and the possible benefits of an action. A community is any group of people that live alongside each other and affect each other\u00b4s wellbeing. This can range from two people to more. Wellbeing means a person\u00b4s status in terms of physical, emotional, mental, social, and any other kind of health. Justice has multiple dimensions: equal choice, equal risk, and equal reward. Equal choice is the idea that all people have the option of choosing the action that their community will follow; the actions that a community takes are decided as a group made up of all the people in that community, with those more at risk given more influence over the decision. This influence can be shown in the form of having more votes on a certain action than other community members, or having a decision restricted only to those at risk from the decision. If these forms of giving influence are problematic or cannot be used, then those at risk should be given increased benefits if the community\u00b4s decision results in benefits. Equal risk is the idea that any possibility of harm from an action is divided equally among the community, or if that is not possible the possibility of harm is separated without unfair treatment towards any member of the community, either through random and blind choice or requests for volunteers, it that is an option. Equal reward is the idea that all people are allowed to benefit from the community\u00b4s choices, and those more at possibility of harm receive an equally greater benefit, or if the benefit cannot be determined quantitatively a greater influence in choosing who receives benefits in the same manner as those with greater risk have more influence over decision making. A benefit is anything, be it object, person, or idea, that could improve a person\u00b4s wellbeing. Harm is an effect that decreases a person\u00b4s wellbeing.\n\nOperationalization:\n\nEqual Choice:\nIn decisions where all members are at the same amount of risk from a decision, all members have the same influence in deciding a course of action. Rate this on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being members strongly disagree and 10 being members strongly agree.\nIn decisions where not all members are at the same amount of risk from a decision, and if influence can be divided, influence is divided among members. Rank this on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being members at risk have less influence than others and 10 being members at risk have more influence than others.\nIn decisions where not all members are at the same amount of risk from a decision, and if influence cannot be divided, each member receives a certain portion of the benefits: Rank this on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being members at risk receive less benefits than others and 10 being members at risk receive more benefits than others.\nEqual Risk:\nDeciding who is at risk from a decision is decided in a manner outlined in the conceptual decision. Rate this on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being members strongly disagree and 10 being members strongly agree.\nIn decisions where it is decided that risk of harm can be separated equally among the community, risk of harm is separated equally. Rate this on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being members strongly disagree and 10 being members strongly agree.\nIn decisions where it is decided that risk of harm cannot be separated equally among the community, those who will receive more risk of harm are chosen without prejudice. Rate this on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being members strongly disagree and 10 being members strongly agree.\nEqual Reward:\nIn decisions that result in benefits, and the benefits can be judged in terms of a physical amount, one\u00b4s risk of harm from the decision is proportionate to the benefits received.

Therefore, assessing face validity was straightforward for me, as I could easily envision those scenarios. \n\nThe other type of validity I considered was criterion-related validity.

These elements made it easy to imagine how they could demonstrate something related to justice as well. \n\nIn terms of reliability, I found the structure of the questions conducive to test-retest reliability. The questions were interconnected in such a way that answering one would likely result in a similar score for another. They were all scaled consistently, from one representing 'disagree' to ten representing 'agree.'\n\nThe other reliability measure I focused on was intercoder reliability, which involves multiple observers.

Being honest refers to the emotional aspect of trust, where one's words and actions align with the mutually understood standards of what is true and are expressed into physical existence. Emotional trust can include loyalty (continuation of backing someone else), connection (feel supported by someone based on similarities and shared interests), faithfulness (a continued affection towards a relationship), openness (being vulnerable enough to share information about oneself) and compassion (feeling so strongly for something that it drives you to continue pursuing a common goal). Informational trust includes handling one's private information if sensitive and being transparent (revealing intentions). Intellectual trust can be seen through decision-making, like staying committed to actions and relying on one to provide accurate information to someone. Second, the perception and actuality of consistency; the belief in the continuation of acts, responses and judgments similar to ones they\u2019ve made in the past. This is an intellectual aspect of trust. 'Belief' includes one using prior knowledge and reinforcement (from similar/consistent actions that have been formed over one\u2019s time knowing another) about someone to predict current and/or future actions they might make. Values (a value for example is reliability [acting consistently well]) shape expectations, which are built through one\u2019s personal background, and reinforce trust. Third, the perception and actuality of seeking positive intent in others.

If I ask them to do something for me and they fulfill that request, and I then return the favor, it embodies the idea of having each other's backs. This mutual support can be especially important when you find yourself in a vulnerable position or when you just need a helping hand, which happens to everyone now and then. When this mutual support occurs because they care about your well-being and want you to succeed and be happy, it reinforces trust.\n\nI trust my oldest friends because they have consistently communicated with me whenever they felt our friendship was off track. They've been completely honest and transparent, saying things like, \"Hey, I feel like you haven't been putting in as much effort into our friendship, and I want to get back to how it was.\" I respect that, and I trust that in similar future scenarios, they will be equally honest. This consistency in behavior forms the foundation of my trust in them, based on my judgment of their character.\n\nTo ensure its validity and reliability, you could use different scenarios as checks for reliability and validity.

When someone is in love they begin to act differently, think differently, and even breathe differently. When someone is not in love they are consumed with themselves. However, the moment someone falls in love they are consumed (everything they do revolves around that person) with the other person. They are overwhelmed with the emotions that come with love. Emotions are deep feelings developed over time. Some of these emotions felt when in love are extreme happiness, nervousness about the future, excitement to see the person, desire to be with that person 24/7, or the peace that resonates with being in that person's presence. Love then turns these emotions into expressions. Expressions are the way emotions of love are shown and given. Love is expressed in different ways and each person receives and gives love differently. Some of these ways are verbal appreciation (telling someone you love and appreciate them, giving them a compliment, or giving them advice in the midst of a tough situation), physical touch (giving a hug, a kiss, or holding their hand), acts of service (bringing someone flowers, buying them a coffee in the morning, remembering their favorite food and bringing it to them for lunch or diner), and quality time (making them a priority in your schedule, being someone they can go to when presented with a dilemma, or taking intentional time to be present with someone). Love then turns these expressions into experiences. Experiences of love are the results of the emotions felt when love is expressed. Examples of experiences is the heat on ones face from blushing, the shortness of breathe because of the suspense what will happen next, the tight throat and watery eyes because of how much they mean to you, or the comfort that comes with being your true self in front of another person for the first time. Emotions, expressions, and experiences are all correlated with each other. Emotions can results in expressions, expressions can cause emotions, expressions can cause experiences, experiences can cause emotions, and experiences can cause expressions.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728619703554, "student": {"_id": "66f7630ae801ab8eec57e44a", "uid": "57yq1fSVsMdFbHseHXrlCIrHPsy1", "email": "colinb23@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727488778075, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Colin Blanchard", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

A poor urban area can be defined as an area characterized by having poor housing, poor infrastructure, and limited access to services. An affluent resident is an individual or family that is considered upper-middle class to high-class and holds a financial advantage over others. In the context of gentrification, an affluent resident holds a financial advantage over an original resident in a particularly poor urban area. This then brings about economic change to that area. This economic change can take many forms but it is most broadly defined as greater investment within this urban area. Greater investment in an area usually includes investment in real estate, local infrastructure and commercial business. This investment may result in improved housing, the attraction of new business, and an overall increase in housing prices, rent, and local services. This economic change may benefit new investors and businesses but can simultaneously place financial strain on existing low-class residents. The influx of affluent residents to a particularly poor urban area also leads to broad community transformation. Community transformation can be characterized by a broad culture shift in a given area, an example of this could be a shift from a blue collar work to white collar work. This can transform the overall demographics of an area which leads to a broad culture shift in that area. This economic and cultural change are the key factors leading to the social displacement of the original residents in a given area. In the context of gentrification, social displacement can be defined as the process where an individual is forced to leave a given area because of the economic and cultural changes brought to that area. It is important to note that gentrification is not a linear process, these dimensions are able to interact in dynamic ways leading to the process of gentrification always looking a little bit different. For example, economic changes can cause a culture shift in a given area and a culture shift can cause economic changes in a given area. Gentrification can lead to an array of broad social effects including a negative psychological impact on displaced residents and negative political implications.\n\n2.\u00a0\nIndicator: Per Capita Income\n\nLevel of measurement: Ratio\n\nIndicator: Real Estate\n\nLevel of measurement: Ratio\n\nIndicator: Demographic changes\n\nLevel of measurement: Nominal\n\nIndicator: Occupational statistics\n\nLevel of measurement: Nominal\n\nIndicator: Survey indicator\n\nLevel of measurement: Interval\n\n3.\u00a0\nIn order to combine my indicators to represent a single numerical value I will have to first standardize each indicator. I am unsure of the mathematical method I will use to this, however, I know that it is possible given the fact that each indicator is measured numerically. I will then need to weight each of my dimensions appropriately. The dimensions of economic change and social displacement will be weighted more heavily than community transformation as I feel as if they are slightly more important than community transformation in analyzing gentrification. I will then need to create scores for each dimension. Once that is completed, I can combine those dimensional scores into a 'gentrification index' which is the single numerical representation I am looking for. The level of measurement of this combined numerical representation would be interval because there is no true zero and there is a meaningful numerical difference.\u00a0\n\n4.\u00a0\nAs a researcher these indicators would be applied in different ways. For the per capita, real estate, demographic, and occupational indicators a researcher would collect and analyze government census data on their own. The displacement survey indicator will be administered to individuals who had recently moved away from an area being evaluated for gentrification. This survey would be voluntary and the participants would be encouraged to answer truthfully. It is important to note that these individuals would need to prove their current state of residence as well as their previous state of residence.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728620782991, "student": {"_id": "669b346d48894798c88b42dc", "uid": "hN7KTbDjCZTlrjgDenUJCW1lhMu2", "email": "aellin2@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1721447533727, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Alex Ellingsen", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

I started with a rather poor original conceptual definition that I pasted into the chatbot, and based on its feedback, it didn't exactly give me these indicators outright but guided me towards them. That's how I ended up choosing them.\n\nSo, there wasn't anything specific that inspired me. It was primarily based on the feedback I received from the chatbot, which significantly helped shape my understanding of gentrification overall. Going into the project, I had heard a bit about gentrification and learned about it in school, but I wasn't very confident in my understanding.

Here is the revised text with correct spelling and grammar:\n\nYes, so I think that economic change is one of the more important factors in the gentrification process. The fact that there's increased investment in these particularly poor urban areas can lead to positive outcomes. It can result in a greater number of local and commercial businesses and an overall increase in money circulating within the area. However, the downside of this is a crucial part of the gentrification process: the burden it places on the original lower-class and poor residents of these urban areas. This burden can be so overwhelming for some families and residents that they are forced to move away entirely. I believe this is how economic change specifically influences social displacement. As more affluent residents move into the area, it drives up the prices of services, housing, rent, water, electricity, and other necessities for a sustainable life, causing drastic increases that lead to social displacement.\n\nRegarding community transformation, it's a more nuanced issue than simply affluent people moving in and causing displacement. It depends on who is moving to the area and who is being displaced. The textbook example often involves primarily Black or African American neighborhoods being gentrified and displaced by an influx of wealthier, usually white individuals, which brings about a complete cultural shift in the area based on the changing demographics. \n\nSo, yes, I think that\u2019s how economic change affects community transformation and the social displacement of a given area."}, {"conversation_id": "6708a57d396a1f88fbc5ab2b", "question": "You mentioned how economic change can drive essential living costs up, causing social displacement.

The first method was face validity, which, although it is a basic form of validity, ensured that everything was logical and sound within the common understanding of gentrification. This was an important starting point.\n\nNext, I utilized content validity, which we also covered in class. Specifically, I planned to use an expert review, allowing me to consult with an expert in gentrification or a social justice researcher in sociology. They would review the indicators I selected to ensure they align with an expert's understanding of gentrification. This approach provides a good way to assess content validity.\n\nThe third method I used to assess the validity of my indicators was criterion validity. This method allows me to examine how well my indicators predict outcomes related to gentrification, such as social displacement and economic change. \n\nRegarding reliability, I chose test-retest reliability to assess the consistency of my results. I planned to recollect the same data shortly after the initial collection to compare the results. However, I recognize that gentrification is a nuanced and dynamic topic, so the time between tests must be short to avoid drastic changes that could result in different data.\n\nThe second method I used to assess reliability was split-half reliability, as discussed in class and in course materials. This involves dividing the indicators into two halves to assess their correlation with each other. For example, if a survey respondent indicates displacement due to high rent prices, I would compare this with actual average rent prices in the area. A high correlation between these indicators would suggest that the data is reliable. \n\nThis is how I approached my operationalization process."}, {"conversation_id": "6708a57d396a1f88fbc5ab2b", "question": "Your approach to ensuring content validity by consulting an expert is insightful.

Conceptual Definition of Trust:\nTrust can be defined as the ability to express yourself to a person whose qualities involve emotional trust where a person makes you feel comfortable and understood by actively listening such as paraphrasing points or using non-verbal cues like nodding and eye contact while the person tries to understand why you feel that way such as asking questions to deepen their understanding. Using this understanding relates to cognitive trust where a person guides you through your reasonings such as logical steps. Regardless of whether the outcomes contribute to goals or decisions, the focus is on the process and the effort proves mutual understanding, which could lead to clarity in reasoning. Building upon the characteristics of emotional and cognitive trust, the consistency of these repeated behaviors is known as behavior trust and putting these into practice whether proactively offering support or responding when requested contributes to maintaining and strengthening the consistency. These concepts help the positive growth of trust between people through consistent and repeated interactions over time.\n2. Indicators (all interval)\nDo you feel comfortable sharing personal details with the person you talk to about your life? (emotional trust)\nDoes the person ask you clarifying questions to better understand what you said? (emotional trust) \nDoes the person accurately summarize what you told them? (emotional trust) \nDoes the person give you appropriate eye contact when you are speaking? (emotional trust)\nDoes this person converse back and forth with you? (cognitive trust) \nDoes this person try to break down your thoughts using logical steps? (cognitive trust) \nDoes this person help you achieve clarity in decision making or clarity in thoughts after your conversation? (cognitive trust)  \nHow often does this person reach out to you to communicate (in person, phone, messages, etc.)? (behavior trust) \nDoes this person respond to you promptly when you reach out?

Then, ChatGPT pointed out that what I was describing is part of behavioral trust. It was a bit challenging to separate my different dimensions because they all kind of build upon each other. However, I feel like behavioral trust was a bit easier to understand because it literally involves behavior, so it relates to consistency. That consistency in behavior is a crucial aspect of trust.\n\nThink about the difference between talking to a stranger and talking to someone you know well; it has a lot to do with the fact that you don't know the stranger. Building trust through repeated interactions led me to include that aspect in behavioral trust. It's not only about trusting someone, confiding in them, or talking to them, but also about having those repeated interactions.\n\nI decided to structure my essay around these concepts because, as I mentioned, they all interconnect. The first one that came to mind was emotional trust because if you don't feel comfortable with someone, it's going to be hard to trust them. The other type of trust I considered was cognitive trust, which has many facets. Ultimately, I focused on whether the person you're deciding to trust is actually helping you, not just solving your problems every time. ChatGPT advised me not to think solely about help because trust doesn't always mean that someone has to help you. It's about whether they attempt to assist you and guide you through your steps, which is a vital part of trust. It's not just about sitting there doing nothing, although sometimes a person might just want you to listen.

That's what I mentioned when I input my ideas into ChatGPT. ChatGPT asked if there were other ways to show that someone is listening, prompting me to consider nonverbal cues. That's why I first thought of nodding and then eye contact.\n\nI didn't think much about eye contact initially because, in my Mexican culture, eye contact isn't emphasized as much. My parents always found it strange that Americans focus so much on eye contact. So, when I included eye contact, I felt a bit uncomfortable because I don't often use it myself during conversations. ChatGPT picked up on this and suggested not just making eye contact, but using appropriate eye contact. I found that helpful.\n\nIn general, whether it's verbal or nonverbal communication, such as summarizing, it's a good way to show you\u2019re paying attention.

This is also an aspect of feeling comfortable, as you don't want to feel judged or like the person doesn't truly want to listen to you. Paying attention is important, and one way to show you are paying attention, or to recognize that someone else is, is through summarizing what has been said. The person doesn't need to remember every single detail, but if they can pick up bits and pieces and understand what you're talking about, that's a good indicator that they are paying attention. I believe it builds emotional trust because, as I said earlier, you don't want to feel like you're approaching someone who doesn't really care or won't remember you. Additionally, as I mentioned in my other indicators or dimension, which was behavioral trust, it's about repeated interactions.

Regarding reliability, I believe these questions can be asked of anyone. It's not so much about different answers on a test, but about the person being assessed. If I conducted my test on someone and they provided answers, and then took a similar test later, they would likely give the same answers unless something significant happened to change their feelings about that person.

Loyalty is characterized by a shared history and a set of behaviors.\n\nThe dimension of shared history refers to the idea of memories, a common past, or something that occurred in one\u2019s past that acts as a foundation to justify the exhibition of loyalty. It also includes the internalization of societal values that may not directly link to personal experiences, but still are a part of someone\u2019s identity. Shared history is necessary for someone to exhibit loyalty, because without the foundation of a shared belief that comes from one\u2019s past, or events that bond someone to another person, creature, or cause there is no reason for that person to be devoted to that particular person, creature, or cause. Material items and brand loyalty also must adhere to the dimension of shared history, as a consumer must have a positive experience associated with that product before they exclusively dedicate their income and taste to the particular brand. Ideological loyalty (loyalty felt towards an idea, typically based on values) also requires shared history as the values that someone adopts can be traced back to past experiences. Even anticipatory loyalty (loyalty towards a future vision or goal) needs shared history to incentivize someone to work toward the future. People may feel loyalty towards a vision that has not been realized, but there must be a justification based on their past that acts as motivation to dedicate themselves to it.\n\nBehaviors that indicate that someone is loyal include consistently showing support (emotional, financial, or physical assistance) to a person or animal, talking positively (this is a behavior that will happen frequently as someone is often looking for opportunities to speak about what one is loyal to, they very complimentary, and are perceived as passionate) to others in professional, academic, and casual contexts, and fiercely defending (justifying, advocating for, and protecting in the face of criticism or harm)\u00a0 the object of one\u2019s loyalty.\"\n\n2: Indicators and Associated Levels of Measurement\n\n\"Dimension 1: Shared History, Past Experience\n\nIndicator: Length of time Questionaire. \"How long have you been loyal to product/person/cause?\"\n\nDimension 2: Shared History, Societal Values\n\nIndicator: Self-Report Opinion Questionaire. \"'On a scale of 'didn't shape me at all' to 'completely shaped me,' how strong was your society and culture's values in shaping your identity?\" \"On a scale of 'I do not align at all' to 'I align completely,' how strongly do you align with the cultural norms you grew up with?\"\u00a0\n\nDimension 3: Behavior, Showing Support\n\nIndicator: Frequency Questionaire. \"On a scale of 'not at all' to 'every day,' how often do you play with your pet?\"\n\nDimension 4: Behavior, Talking Positively\n\nIndicator: Frequency Questionaire. \"On a scale of 'not at all' to 'all the time,' how often do you mention your spouse in conversation?\"\n\nDimension 5: Behavior, Defending\n\nIndicator: Self-Report Opinion Questionaire. \"On a scale of 'not likely at all' to 'incredibly likely,' how likely are you to correct someone who made a politically incorrect comment about your party?\"\n\n3: Combined Numerical Representation Reasoning and Level of Measurement\n\n\"Score averages will be taken for each of the 5 dimensions, and will be measured out of 10. This is due to many of the questions being based on a scale out of ten themselves. Then all 5 scores will be added up into an overall score out of 50. If a participant scores a 35 or higher, we can conclude that participant exhibits a significant amount of loyalty day to day. This threshold is based on theoretical decision-making and is aligned with the understanding that higher scores reflect above-average loyalty. All dimensions are weighted equally.\n\nThe level of measurement of the combined numerical representation is ratio.\"\"\n\n4: Procedure for Applying Indicators for Data Collection\n\n\u00a0\"I will administer the questionnaire on a secure online platform with encrypted databases where the stored information can only be accessed by the research team...The survey evaluates volunteers on my observable indicators of loyalty: shared history relating to past experience, shared history relating to societal values, behavior relating to showing support, behavior relating to talking positively about the sample's objects of loyalty, and behavior relating to defending the sample's objects of loyalty. There will be 2 versions of the survey, identical in every way except for the order of the questions on each of the 5 dimensions, which will be randomized on both forms...Based on the survey's use of the Likert scale, the volunteers who answer higher values in each dimension should exhibit a high amount of loyalty in their everyday lives.\"", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728624923144, "student": {"_id": "66f4d8f1e801ab8eec57e349", "uid": "M7RrZDOuFcY9ZQDmji3A26ASFLL2", "email": "fireive@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727322353621, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Faith Ireland Reive", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

For me, when I think about loyalty, I believe there needs to be something that has happened in someone's past that has bonded them to a person or a pet. It's about the idea of shared experience, something that motivates your dedication towards the object of your loyalty. \n\nWhat inspired me to explore loyalty through the lens of shared history is that I believe it's the first step. You can't have loyalty without a reason for that loyalty, if that makes sense. When it comes to behavior, I think loyalty is expressed through behaviors and traits. I believe loyalty can be divided into categories like how you support a person, show up for them, be there for them, and express your loyalty in that way. \n\nOn the flip side, being loyal when the person or object is not present\u2014when they are not part of the conversation\u2014is where speaking positively about them comes into play. It's about saying, \"This is a person, pet, thing, object, or brand that I think highly of, and I want to share this with another person in a casual or professional context because I'm deeply affected and motivated by it.\"\n\nRegarding defending, my last point, I think that when someone directly harms, criticizes, or speaks badly about the object of your loyalty, it might incite a reaction to defend it. It's about saying, \"No, that's not correct. I stand by this person, cause, political party, and so forth, one hundred percent, and here's my reasoning, here's my shared history for doing so.\"\n\nWhat surprised me in my research was the amount of pushback I received against the concept of shared history. The chatbot seemed unwilling to accept that there was a reason behind loyalty. The examples given were anticipatory or focused on future incentives, but I was surprised by the resistance I encountered on that front.

This ties into the idea of shared history, as something somewhere somehow needed to have happened for you to exhibit loyalty toward a person, thing, cause, etc.\n\nWhen I think about societal norms and values shaping loyalty, I recall what I said in my essay. I mentioned that there are norms you grow up with that become part of your identity and shape what you understand to be normal. For instance, as an American woman, I have the freedom to speak openly, whereas, in other parts of the world, like the Middle East, that freedom may not exist, and the thoughts and opinions of women may not be as valued or emphasized as they are in America.\n\nHow does this relate to loyalty? Based on history and how you grew up in your childhood environment, you are taught what is considered normal. While this may not necessarily be tied to your identity, it's still ingrained in you, if that makes sense. This plays into loyalty because it is influenced by what you are first taught by the society and environment in which you are raised.

These societal norms form the basis of our way of life and influence the mindset with which we grow up. This, in turn, impacts loyalty because shared experiences and history with others shape our attitudes and loyalties.\n\nI was trying to express how societal norms affect your beliefs and loyalties, not necessarily your identity itself, but rather the environment you grew up in. This shared history and foundational beliefs influence decisions about what you choose to be loyal to.\n\nWhen discussing diverse cultural backgrounds, I think this is different for everyone. Even if everyone grows up in the same society, what I am loyal to may not be the same as what an African American individual is loyal to. Discussing race can be complex, but I don't believe the strength of loyalty is affected by cultural background. I think I can be as fiercely loyal as anyone else from a different cultural background. However, the nature of loyalty\u2014what I am loyal to\u2014is influenced by my experiences and societal factors.\n\nI'm loyal to a person because of our shared history, while someone else from a different identity, background, or gender might have different loyalties based on their experiences and upbringing.

Here's a revised version of your text with improved spelling and grammar:\n\n---\n\nFor the sake of validity, as the survey asked, I implemented three measures to ensure that I was thorough and approached the topic from different angles. The first measure was face validity. This term can be tricky when repeated often, but it refers to a superficial evaluation: does this make sense to the average person who likely has a very basic understanding? When considering indicators like shared history, cultural background, supportive behavior, defensive behavior, and positive communication, these all logically relate to how loyalty connects with those factors.\n\nFollowing face validity, I examined content validity. This is where you compare the definitions involved and assess if they accurately encompass the entire concept. Sorry, I momentarily blanked, but I want to make sure I cover everything accurately. It's about the degree to which the composite of my indicators fully represents the concept of loyalty. My operationalization involves ensuring that my indicators reflect every facet and comprehensively define it.\n\nThe third measure was convergent validity, which involves ensuring that a measure correlates with other measures that are conceptually related. For example, in my research, I examined whether the answers related to loyalty correlated with concepts like trustworthiness and commitment. If someone scores high in loyalty, there is likely a corresponding high score in commitment and trustworthiness.\n\nBy using face validity, content validity, and convergent validity, I aimed to ensure the validity and reliability of my indicators.

I mentioned that I would be conducting a survey with a questionnaire I designed. I planned to include questions and gave examples to the Sherpa and in my assignment, such as: \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not at all likely and 10 being completely likely, how often do you play with your pet?\" This question related to showing support.\n\nI remember that example clearly. Essentially, when I think about it, that was just a sample question. Based on my five dimensions and the indicators I used, I would have categories of questions for all five dimensions: cultural norms, shared behavior, positive discussions, defending it, and showing support. For each of these five categories, there would be questions that I feel encompass the multifaceted nature of loyalty.\n\nI would compile the scores from these five categories, add them up, and calculate an average. Then, I would take the average of each of the five categories, combine those averages, and calculate another average, resulting in a score out of fifty. This scoring would move from a scale of 0 to 10, using interval ratio levels of measurement.\n\nSo, with those scales of measurement, based on how respondents answered the questions, I would add up the scores, average them, then average the averages, resulting in a score out of fifty. Essentially, ten points per category add up to fifty in total.\n\nTo answer how I ensured the questions effectively captured each dimension of loyalty: each dimension representing loyalty would have its own category, be scored, and recorded.

It helps me present my ideas in a manner that the scientific community can understand and agree with. Regarding the question about conceptual definitions and how using a chatbot to gather feedback impacts my understanding of loyalty, I believe it helped me articulate my thoughts in a way that makes sense for this assignment. \n\nWhile it did enhance my definitions, reaching that enhancement required me to confront certain aspects that I initially thought I understood. The chatbot challenged me because I was being vague, forcing me to elaborate. This elaboration, in turn, improved my definitions. When it comes to the concept of a shared history, that was particularly difficult for me. The chatbot kept pushing me to reconsider the idea that loyalty is purely based on shared experiences, which felt too simplistic to me. In my mind, loyalty requires motivation and a shared history to develop. \n\nInteracting with a chatbot, which is not capable of loyalty in a human sense, was challenging, but ultimately beneficial. Regarding behavioral dimensions, the chatbot simply pushed me to elaborate more rather than opposing my initial articulation. As a tool, I found the chatbot very helpful; I used it more for elaboration than for defining terms, yet it provided valuable feedback. The feedback was similar to what I might receive from Dr. Pierce and Tiana, so I was happy with it. I enjoyed using the chatbot and found it fun, although I did experience some frustration when I ran out of tokens and had to postpone completing the assignment. \n\nIf there were a way to work around the limited ChatGPT tokens, that would be beneficial, but I understand it's beyond Dr. Pierce's and Skjolnir's roles as the TA. On another note, I accidentally banged my knee, but overall, I enjoyed the experience and would use the chatbot again. I thought it was a good tool."}]}, "6708b539396a1f88fbc5bcfd": {"_id": "6708b539396a1f88fbc5bcfd", "created_at": 1728623929799, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "1. Sexuality is the attraction a person has to one or more people for the purposes of having sex. Its key dimensions are arousal, sexual orientation, and sexual identity. Arousal is defined as the mental and physical response that one has to those they are attracted to. These mental responses include sexual thoughts and the desire to be physically intamate. These physical reactions include the release of sex-related hormones, increase of blood flow to genitals, incresed sensitivity, and in some cases nervousness (sweating, blushing, fidgeting, etc), however this varies by person. Sexual orientation is the gender identity(s) that a person is attracted to. Gender has two dimensions, those being gender identy and gender presentation. Gender Identity is a persons internal understanding of who they are and their relationship to the social expectations of masculinity, femininity, and angdrogyny.  These expectations can include the socially-accepted behaviors and roles a society determines for different genders. This is the dimension that sexual orientation is predicated on. Gender presentation is the way a person expresses their gender which include what clothes they wear, pronouns and name they use, and way they act. Sexual identity is the way a person characterizes their attraction to certain genders in accordence to a culture's already-created labels for homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual attraction. These labels are the words we use to describe the genders of people we want to have sexual relationships with. Homosexual is attraction to only your own gender. Bisexual is the attraction to multiple genders. Heterosexual is the attraction to a gender that is not your own (generally attraction shared between women and men). \n\n2. \n\nIn measuring sexuality, we will be considering its dimentions of: arousal, sexual orientation, and sexual identity.\n\nSexual Orientaion is defined as the gender or gender one is attracted to. We will measure this by:\n\n-Participants are presented with various images of people along with their gender and perferred pronouns, and asked to rate their sexual attractiveness on a half-point scale from 1-10 (interval).\n\n-Participants would then be asked about which genders they are attracted to (interview).\n\n-I am attracted to men. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-I am attracted to women. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-I am attracted to genderqueer people. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\nArousal is defined as the mental and physical response that one has to those they are attracted to. We will measure this by:\n\n-Arousal can be conducted in more or less invasive manners. We can measure the amounts of certian sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and oxytocin) when participants interact with different persons they are or are not attrcted to (psyiological data-ratio/interval). Another factor is measuring nervousness, but it would need to be stated that this varies person to person. For instance a heartrate monitor could be used to track increased heart-rate (physiological data-interval). This would be done in a controlled setting to account for no outside stresses on participants to reduce the influence of other things on heartrate. Participants can self-report when they were feeling most aroused to see if this aligns with the data collected from the monitor (interview). \n\n-I was aroused by person A. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-I was aroused by person B. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-When did you feel most aroused? (interview participants for a fuller understanding of their attraction)\n\nSexual Identity is defined as the sexuality labels one uses and their attachment to it: \n\n-Due to the categorical nature of these demographics, this measuremnt will be nominal. Measurable indicators will be based on self-reports, and then coded by researchers.\n\n-What is your Sexual Identity? Answers (check all that apply): lesbian, gay/homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, demisexual, heterosexual, unlabeled (nominal)\n\n-I identify strongly with a particular sexuality label. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-My sexuality has changed over time. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-What has your experience with sexual identity been? (interview participants for a fuller understanding)\n\nThe study could then examine these factors and see if the way that someone labels themself, rates attractiveness, and feels arousal all align to be the same sexuality or if sexuality is more complicated and nuanced than that.  \n\n3.\n\nSexual Orientaion:\n\n-Researchers will average the results for rating attraction to women, men, and genderqueer people, creating a score for each group. These scores may be divided in half to find their equivilencies in a 5 point system. The higher the score is, the better indication it is for sexual attraction. \n\n-Researchers will create scores based on answers with the higher (strongly agree) meaning higher sexual attraction.\n\nArousal:\n\n-After showing each image, researchers would note any significant changes in heartbeat. They would tally these for each gender, and create a number based on how attracted that person is to each gender category. This would then be compared with the reports of the people. These talleys would be turned into fractions over /5 to be compatible with the first part of the study.\n\nSexual Identity:\n\n-This isn't numerical, mainly a way of comparing numerical data to nominal categories. There are some more numerical aespects to this indicator, like how strongly one feels connected to their sexuality, but this is more for richer understanding and to compare to the scores for sexual preference. \n\nI can compare the score from section 1 and the score from 2 and they should correlate (the genders rated as sexually attractive should be at about the same amount as those one is aroused by). They can be averaged into individual scores for genders (which is translated into language through labels).\n\n \n\nThere is no way I can conceive to present my findings in a single number, but rather a graph that shows attraction numbers to various people. One can be attracted to men and women and genderqueer people, for instance in different amounts or not at all. Instead I would use these as benchmarks with high attraction to the same gender correlating with the label \"gay\" and the opposite with \"hetero\". \n\n4. \n\nSexual Orientaion:\n\n-Participants are presented with various images of people along with their gender and perferred pronouns, and asked to rate their sexual attractiveness on a half-point scale from 1-10. The people presented in this experiment would be of various nationalities and races to account for various preferences and to not favor one over another. These scores would be divided into women, men, and genderqueer categories and then added up and averaged. The higher the score, the more sexual attraction one shows towards a particular gender. This would then be an indicator of sexuality.\n\n-Participants would then be asked about which genders they are attracted to. This would be an interview question to allow for people to decribe their attraction to genders in a more nuanced and detailed way. Researchers can code this, and also note that strict gender categories used in the studies may be changed or challenged by particiapnts who may feel it doesn't fit their experience of gender.\n\n-I am attracted to men. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval) \n\n-I am attracted to women. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-I am attracted to genderqueer people. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\nThese would be a survey, with the higher score being an indication of attraction. These can be compared to the scores from the first part of the experiment to average to scores for each gender. The higher the score, the more attraction to a gender. These can then later be compared to the labels we have defined to see if the words we have for sexuality.\n\nArousal is defined as the mental and physical response that one has to those they are attracted to. We will measure this by:\n\n-We can measure the amounts of certian sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and oxytocin) when participants interact with different persons they are or are not attrcted to (psyiological data). I will admit a limitation here, that I do not know how hormones are measured in experiments. Perhaps we can tell based on brain scans or blood samples? Either of these come with limitations of their own (especially becoem more invasive measures can have a negitive effect on arousal). I would typically do some outside research about how these things are measured, however that is not allowed for this project. So I will state that this experiment would happen in a controlled environment that would allow for methods to measure hormone release in the least-invasive way possible. If this is impossible, I am okay eliminating it from the study.\n\nAnother factor is measuring nervousness/excitement, but it would need to be stated that this varies person to person. For instance a heartrate monitor could be used to track increased heart-rate (physiological data). This would be done in a controlled setting to account for no outside stresses on participants to reduce the influence of other things on heartrate. The participants would be presented with erotic images/videos of persons of various gender. Participants can self-report when they were feeling most aroused to see if this aligns with the data collected from the monitor (interview). A spike in heartrate could indicate attraction, especially if this aligns with their own report. For each image, the researchers would mark if the person showed a considerable change in heartrate. They would then tally up the times according to certain gender.\n\n-I was aroused by person A. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-I was aroused by person B. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-When did you feel most aroused? (interview participants for a fuller understanding of their attraction)\n\nAs always, the higher score the more attraction to that specific gender. One would hope that if the test were reliable, the participants would say they were attracted to the same people their heart beat faster to. Also, for this as for all of the studies, it should be mentioned that the answers are private and to be very honest. \n\nSexual Identity: \n\n-What is your Sexual Identity? Answers (check all that apply): lesbian, gay/homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, demisexual, heterosexual, unlabeled (nominal)\n\n-I identify strongly with a particular sexuality label. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-My sexuality has changed over time. Answers: 1-5 Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (interval)\n\n-What has your experience with sexual identity been? (interview participants for a fuller understanding)\n\nThis would be done through survey and interview to gain insight into how people characterize their attraction. Participants may be better-suited if they feel strongly about their sexual identity, but sexuality is not defined only by LGBTQ people, so it is importnat that all sexualities are included. In all, there should be a great consideration to be senitive and allow for options for people who aren't attracted to anyone. It also should be clear that sexuality labels are respected no matter what the data says from the study, that it is just a way of looking as a social phenomenon.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728664565017, "student": {"_id": "66f716bbe801ab8eec57e3d9", "uid": "dxVWLBIpGXeIUj4R7G1v00IFp852", "email": "rg143@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727469243273, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Ryen Glynn", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

The other side was mental arousal, which involves the mental process of being aroused. This is not something easy to quantify, and some of the dimensions I considered, as Chachi Priti pointed out, occur very inconsistently across individuals. For example, things like getting really nervous, sweating, or an increased heart rate can be signs of arousal, but not everyone experiences these. It was therefore challenging to find something universal.

Based on those scores, we compare them to the sexual identity portion, hoping to see if our cultural terms align with the definitions we've created. We understand that our definitions might be a bit too narrow, especially considering the wide scope of attraction among genderqueer people.\n\nIn terms of reliability and validity, I discussed how those aspects could be compared both internally and externally to ensure validity. I made sure to include physiological data because it's generally considered more reliable and valid, as many of the elements I'm testing are interval data types. Physiological data is often seen as more reliable, especially when conducted in a highly controlled environment.

For instance, it was pretty good at discussing conceptual and operational definitions in general, but when it came to the nuances of sexuality, I felt like it had a hard time providing more specific feedback. Nonetheless, I feel like I understand things better now, especially how to write and format operational definitions. It guided me on how to structure it with questions, which was very helpful. While I found it helpful, I don't think it will influence me to use it again, as I might choose not to rely on it in the future. However, I do think it's a good tool for checking for bias\u2014not to imply that the chatbot itself is unbiased\u2014but it's effective for that purpose and for checking my overall learning. I found it valuable for receiving feedback that indicated I was ready to move on, as it boosted my confidence and made me feel that my definitions were strong enough."}]}, "6708cd5b396a1f88fbc5edf4": {"_id": "6708cd5b396a1f88fbc5edf4", "created_at": 1728630107118, "is_complete": true, "student_work": "conceptualization:\u00a0\n\nBody image dissatisfaction refers to having a negative perception of one's physical appearance, usually due to a discrepancy between their actual body and their ideal body, comparison to societal beauty standards, or body dysmorphia. This dissatisfaction results in physical and psychological dimensions, which contribute to how someone experiences their appearance and responds to it.\n\n\n\n\nDiscrepancy refers to a difference between one's current appearance and their ideal appearance, whether that means gaining/losing weight, gaining muscle, height, symmetry, or other attributes. If their body does not align with their personal or cultural ideals, they may feel dissatisfaction.\n\nSocietal beauty standards refer to standards of physical appearance, propagated by media and social media. Traits such as height, weight, amount of muscle, proportions, symmetry, skin tone, and hair texture, are all emphasized. These standards create external pressure, which can make you feel dissatisfied if your appearance does not align with them.\n\n\n\n\nBody dysmorphia is a mental health condition in which a person over-exaggerates or fully imagines flaws in their appearance that a third party may not even notice or care about. This can cause a person to turn their perceived flaws into shortcomings. Over-exaggeration is when there is when someone magnifies minor or imagined flaws, perpetuating a cycle in which minor flaws cause intense distress. A perceived flaw is a characteristic of one\u2019s body that they view negatively, usually based on societal beauty standards.\n\n\n\n\nThere are emotional dimensions that arise because of body dissatisfaction. One example is shame, which in this context creates a sense of embarrassment over one's appearance. Shame also leads to a lower sense of self-worth and can be triggered by societal beauty standards. Self-worth refers to a person\u2019s internal sense of respect, regardless of how others may view them. In this context, lower self-worth arises when someone feels that their appearance is inadequate. Another example is anxiety, the feeling/fear of being judged on your appearance by others. Shame and anxiety are internal emotional reactions that can lead to physical behaviors, but first manifest themselves internally and cause dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\n\nThe emotional dimension can also result in several behaviors, leading to the behavioral dimension. However, it is important to acknowledge that the behaviors themselves are separate from the emotions, and belong in their own distinct category. Those experiencing body image dissatisfaction may attempt to change their appearance in unhealthy ways. For example, excessive dieting, or overtraining in the gym, which does more harm than good. The behavioral dimension often stems from emotional responses such as shame and anxiety. Usually, people diet or train excessively out of fear of nor matching up to societal standards, attempting to reduce the discrepancy between their current and ideal bodies. This dimension includes actions taken in response to emotional distress. For example, shame manifests in several behaviors, such as wearing baggy clothes, avoiding mirrors, having poor posture, or using excess makeup to cover up perceived flaws. This is all to hide one\u2019s physique or avoid thinking about it. Furthermore, anxiety can cause people to socially isolate themselves by staying indoors and not going to the gym, social events, or other places where their body may be exposed. Physical symptoms of anxiety could be an increased heart rate, or sweating, which can also influence behavior. For example, if you sweat a lot due to anxiety, you will perhaps avoid wearing white or other bright colors to avoid pit stains.\n\nThe final dimension is the social and psychological dimension. Comparison is a key factor is causing body image dissatisfaction. Individuals often compare themselves to others, especially those they see on social media and in TV/movies, who are among some of the best-looking people on earth. The peddling of unrealistic beauty standards exacerbates the feeling of dissatisfaction.\u00a0Social comparison, especially when one measures themselves up against unrealistic beauty standards, triggers emotional responses like shame and anxiety, which in turn drives behavioral responses such as physical isolation or excessive dieting.\n\noperationalization:\u00a0\n\ndiscrepancy dimension\n\nFirst indicator: gap between current and ideal body:\n\nQuestion: On a scale from 1 (no difference) to 5 (extremely high difference) how much does your current body differ from your dream body, in terms of muscle, weight, symmetry, proportions, height, etc.\nParticipants will rate the difference between their current body and their ideal body on a scale from one to ten.\n\nSecond indicator: desired changes:\n\nQuestion: How would u rank these aspects of your body that you would like to change, in order from most desirable to least desirable?\u00a0\ncheck all that apply:\nlose weight\ngain weight\ngain muscle\nlose muscle\ngrow taller\nclear up acne\ngrow hair longer\ncut hair shorter\ngrow facial hair\nother (please specify)\nprocedure:\nParticipants rank which physical changes they would like to make to their body from a checklist.

The chatbot is very strict about making sure you define everything clearly. It uses the Russian nesting doll analogy, which really expanded my understanding of these two concepts.

To commit and support something means to engage in dedication to it, both actively (engaging in activities to demonstrate loyalty) and passively (avoiding anything that may betray what the subject is loyal to). The subject's relationship to these competing alternatives can help demonstrate their level of loyalty to the given institution or person. The pressure or temptations from these alternatives and the response from the subject can help provide a measure or understanding of their level of loyalty.\n\nOne dimension of loyalty could be psychological; this is a state of mind that someone might have that strengthens their commitment to something. The state of mind can both emotionally (feelings of attachment) and cognitively (conscious decisions based on reason) influence the subject's level of loyalty. An indicator we can measure this with is with a survey on loyalty. Participants can rate on a scale from 1-10 how committed they feel to certain things in their life, such as their company, their romantic partner, the city they live in, etc.\n\nA second dimension of loyalty could be behavioral, which is a physical demonstration or pattern of a person being loyal to something. A physical demonstration can be many things, such as body language, going out of your way to physically support what you are loyal to, or physical intimacy to a romantic partner. The frequency, effort, and consistency of all these help measure behavioral loyalty. A pattern of behavioral loyalty is when an action repeats consistently, while one-off behaviors are infrequent and typically are weaker indicators. An indicator of this could be tracking what percentage of gas refills occur at the same gas station. If someone goes to fill their car up at the same station every time, they are more loyal to that particular gas station.\n\n3. I can create a loyalty score from the first indicator by averaging all the responses on the 1-10 scale while also conceptualizing a numerical grade for the possible responses to the open ended questions. There could also be a loyalty score for the gas station indicator based on their frequency of attending their main gas station. I would add the gas station score to the survey score, but it'd be important that the survey score holds more weight than the gas station score. This is because the survey score is representative of more aspects of life. The level of measurement should probably be out of 11 points (up to 10 for survey score and up to 1 for gas station score).\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728634465909, "student": {"_id": "66fa2b53cfeaac6b6ec09937", "uid": "aiUQ5nwXWTOeCe1rRqu1TgaHAXA2", "email": "mklauser@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727671123428, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Maxwell Klauser", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

This experience can be present over a long period of time or occur as a result of specific internal or external conditions. These internal and external perceptions work together to construct one\u2019s body image that the dissatisfaction is derived from. Internal perception could relate to what one\u2019s body is physically capable of as well as one\u2019s general health while external perception can be determined by social ideals of how bodies are portrayed in the media or cultural and regional norms relating to food or exercise. While these internal and external factors can work together to form body image, an individual can find themselves more influenced by one over the other depending on what the individual determines to be more critically important. Body image refers to how a person internally perceives their physical appearance based on things such as their weight, how it is carried, the shape of their body, and the society\u2019s norm of what a body should look like. Dissatisfaction refers to the negative aspects, such as feelings or thoughts, one associates with their body. This can manifest through the emotional dimensions of dissatisfaction, which are feelings of guilt with oneself for how they treat their body or their appearance in relation to internal perception, feelings of jealousy in terms of comparing one\u2019s body to what is deemed the ideal body in relation to external perception, feelings of frustration for not being able to attain the ideal body, or thoughts of not being good enough as a result considering both internal and external perceptions. For some, these emotional manifestations can lead to behavioral choices such as disordered eating, avoidance of social situations, or obsessive exercise that further reinforce dissatisfaction with one\u2019s body image.\n\n\n\n\nOperationalization:\u00a0\n\nBody image dissatisfaction manifests itself through a variety of behaviors associated with emotional and cognitive dimensions including guilt, jealousy, frustration, disordered eating, avoidance, and obsessive exercise. I will conduct a survey that includes a variety of close ended indicators for those dimensions which I will then aggregate the data into a scoring system where those with higher scores will indicate body image dissatisfaction. Due to multiple indicators per dimension, I will use the average score for each dimension when calculating the total amount of body image dissatisfaction. While most of my indicators adhere to the Likert scale, there are some that account for the frequency of a behavior in which the frequency of that behavior will be added to the final numerical value. For behaviors that are occasional, I will take into consideration the selection of strongly agree. Whereas more persistant behaviors will rate highly for both slightly and strongly agree. Disordered eating and obsessive exercising will also weigh more when determining a final numerical value as they are stronger indicators of body image dissatisfaction. In assessing the numerical values, I will indicate a range in which I will be able to indicate the higher scores associated with more severe dissatisfaction as well as those with moderate and mild. Because certain dimensions have more weight and the averages of each dimension will be totaled, we will still be able to properly assess dissatisfaction despite individuals scoring strongly are on some but slightly agree on others.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728634013599, "student": {"_id": "66f76737cfeaac6b6ec098e3", "uid": "R4P5pU3lmAgmPNysOSk4GyjtmHr2", "email": "srocha2@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727489847521, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Sophia Rocha", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Jealousy most often occurs in valuable relationships because they hold significant emotional importance. \u00a0So any perceived threat (e.g. an outside person) to these relationships can trigger feelings of jealousy. Additionally, jealousy could extend to professional environments, where people fear loosing achievements (rank and standing) and opportunities (chances to advance or succeed professionally) to someone else.\n\nThere are three main dimensions to jealousy, first is emotional (personal internal feelings), second is cognitive (thoughts and perceptions), third is behavioral (actions taken in response to feelings, thoughts and perceptions). The emotional aspect of jealousy include feelings of insecurity, sadness, envy, uneasiness and resentment. The cognitive aspects of jealousy include suspicion (not trusting someone), constantly comparing oneself to others (picking on qualities others have but you don't), obsessive thoughts (constantly thinking of someone doings), or worries of being replaced (thinking that you're not good enough). Lastly, the behavioral aspect include closely monitoring a person, seeking re-assurance (confirmations of someone's feelings/affection to you), gatekeeping (limiting someone's access opportunities driven by the fear of loosing something valued) and confrontations (bringing up suspicions about perceived threat).\u00a0\n\nThese dimensions can occur simultaneously or in different sequences depending on the person and the situation. It is possible to display behavioral reactions, such as confronting someone, before fully processing their emotions or thoughts. Additionally, jealousy can vary depending on the type of relationship you have. In professional environments, jealousy might be present more as concerns over status and achievements, leading to competitive behaviors and gatekeeping of resources, opportunities, etc. In romantic relationships, jealousy is present with an emphasis on trustworthiness and faithfulness, which can result in more emotional confrontations.\n\nEmotional\n\n1.

Jealousy often relates to or includes other feelings such as anxiety, insecurity, fear, sadness, loneliness, resentment, and similar emotions. I find these emotions particularly interesting and fascinating because they are negative and usually looked down upon, often not discussed much. However, they are relatable since everyone experiences them. That's why I chose jealousy. I think jealousy, in particular, carries a significant negative connotation and is also quite taboo to discuss openly.\n\nI thought it would be an intriguing topic to explore. Another reason I chose it is that jealousy often arises in interpersonal relationships that have deeper connections, such as family, romantic, or platonic relationships. I find it interesting to explore how jealousy arises in these contexts.\n\nAs a young adult, I relate to the aspect of jealousy in personal relationships, which is distinct from professional relationships. While jealousy can exist in professional settings, it tends to be discussed more in the context of personal relationships. Being a student, I may not fully capture how jealousy plays out in professional settings as I am not yet part of the workforce.\n\nAdditionally, I find the dimensions of jealousy really interesting because they are relatable, and I believe everyone has experienced them before. I identified three dimensions: emotional, cognitive, and behavioral. Initially, I only considered cognitive and behavioral dimensions, but ChatGPT suggested I include the cognitive dimension, which turned out to be a smart addition. The cognitive aspect acts as the missing piece, explaining everything. Emotion relates to what you feel, the cognitive aspect involves your thoughts and perceptions, and the behavioral aspect includes actions taken in response to your thoughts, perceptions, and feelings.\n\nMy thought process while writing this essay was to make it relatable to young adults, especially those in romantic relationships. However, I kept the indicators/questions general enough so that people who have deep friendships and family connections can still respond.

Then, ChatGPT suggested that I add another dimension, which was the behavioral dimension. \n\nThe emotional dimension pertains to one's feelings, the cognitive dimension involves one's thoughts and perceptions, and the behavioral dimension relates to one's actions in response to these thoughts and feelings. \n\nAs I developed these dimensions, I brainstormed words associated with jealousy, such as insecurity, fear, loss, uneasiness, and discomfort. These words kept appearing, which helped me conceptualize the behavioral aspect. I considered what typically happens when someone is jealous and thought of everyday situations. For example, how a romantic couple might react if one partner cheated on the other. In such scenarios, there would likely be confrontations, and the affected partner might seek more reassurance due to feelings of jealousy.\n\nAs I wrote the essay, I noticed interesting aspects of these dimensions. They don't always occur in a particular order. Typically, it starts with the emotional dimension, followed by cognitive, and then behavioral. However, sometimes this order changes. Behavioral responses can occur first, followed by cognitive and then emotional reactions, particularly when people act before they think\u2014especially when they're angry or jealous.\n\nIn summary, this is how I developed the concept of these dimensions and some insights I gained during the writing process."}, {"conversation_id": "6708f63d396a1f88fbc6abb8", "question": "It's interesting that you noticed how the sequence of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions can vary.

In situations where behavior comes first, it may reveal a lot about someone's ability to process and control their emotions. However, it also depends on the situation, as the intensity can vary. For example, the intensity of rage related to jealousy in a particular situation can differ. Since this varies, a single instance of a person acting on their thoughts before fully thinking them through doesn't necessarily dictate their overall ability to control their emotions.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the nature of jealousy, the term itself is associated with negativity and is often indicated by various negative emotions. It essentially stems from a fear of loss or an overprotectiveness towards something, as well as insecurity about being at risk of losing it. Therefore, the nature of jealousy is predominantly negative, but the sequence of events and emotions can vary."}, {"conversation_id": "6708f63d396a1f88fbc6abb8", "question": "It's insightful how you connected behavior-first reactions to emotional processing and the nature of jealousy.

The questions are based on the dimensions and their indicators.\n\nTo focus on validity, I wrote about it on Canvas, specifically discussing convergent validity. To establish the study's validity, we can compare it with other similar studies that cover related constructs, such as anxiety, insecurity, or fear of loss. If the results correlate appropriately, it would mean that the study is valid, as these emotions and terms are related or very similar. If the scores respond appropriately, it suggests the study's validity. I also mentioned content validity, emphasizing the need for consulting experts in the field to ensure everything is accurately represented.\n\nLastly, I discussed performing a factor analysis, which involves identifying common factors in the responses for each dimension. This ensures that the indicators align with the dimension being measured. Regarding reliability, I mentioned that the questionnaire or survey could be repeated after a certain period with the same participants to check if the results remain consistent. I also brought up Cronbach's alpha, which addresses internal consistency. Although we haven't talked about it in-depth, I read about it at a surface level.

Altruism is an expression of care and concern for others that transcends oneself, it is the unselfish role of putting others above oneself. \"Care\" can be defined as an act of support towards others, mainly encompassing their emotional well-being. Caring makes a person feel loved and valued by those who care for them. \"Concern\" is an aspect similar to care, involving emotional support, which is supporting another person emotionally. However, concern encompasses worrying about another person and their feelings, while care is the act of expressing that worry and showing support to others. \"Unselfish\" is the act of doing something without want of something in return. Being unselfish is to care and have concern for another individual regardless of any negative feelings one may have. The act of altruism can be shown through actions like giving social support (caring for others both emotionally and physically), expressing compassion (feeling sympathy and understanding for what others are going through to such an extent that one may feel it themselves), assisting (the giving of physical help and advice) others despite any feelings of an unforgiving nature (having negative feelings, like resentment, towards another because of something they've done), and through the act of self-sacrifice (giving up one's own happiness or dreams in order to help another and thus putting them before yourself). Altruism means to help someone, even if a person is one's own worst enemy, as putting one's own negative feelings above helping a person would be selfish. Putting others above oneself is the very core of the concept of altruism. No matter who or how one feels about a person, being unselfish in one's regard of them by helping them in any of way like the actions expressed above, is true altruism.\n\n2.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI express care towards others\u201d (care) -

I am going to combine my indicators by averaging them, each indicator and its level of measurement will be weighted the same. To do this I would split all of my indicators into categories by the dimensions that they represent and then average the scores that each dimension has. So, every dimension would have an average score. The two levels of measurement would be weighted the same. The level of measurement of the combined numerical representation would be interval, because I'm averaging the ordinal and interval data together and treating both as interval data with equal intervals between each score or value.\n\n4. A researcher would apply these indicators through a survey to the general public of ages 18 and up. The survey results would be separated by certain demographics to see how altruistic behaviors carry across various groups, like different age groups, genders and socio-economic statuses. This could also be used to ensure a greater diversity of participants to make the survey more generalizable to everyone in the general public. I think general instructions about the survey would be given to the participants like how it aims to understand altruism and how people engage in the behaviors related to the concept. Explanation on how to answer the questions as well as an acknowledgement that the survey is completely confidential and so their identities would not be written anywhere in the findings of the study. Their emails or phone numbers would be recorded with their results in order to be able to retest their results at a later date in order to ensure Test-Retest Reliability. Informing participants that their survey participation is completely voluntary and thus they can withdraw from it without repercussions. The only special considerations I can think of are benefits, so what the participants would get in return for completing the survey, pilot testing, retesting the survey and cultural differences. The participants would receive some monetary amount of around $5 for completing the survey and would be offered an additional $10 to complete the test again one month later. Pilot testing would be done before the official testing for the survey in order to ensure that the indicators are testing what they should and that the questions are fully understood. Through the pilot testing the indicators can be evaluated on whether all of them are generally appropriate for everyone culturally and ethically.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1728643094694, "student": {"_id": "66f780e1cfeaac6b6ec09906", "uid": "n5YbrZv5zrfUwlqvjEw1S5gMYe33", "email": "nixi3@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1727496417880, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Nikita Stewart", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Authenticity is the quality of being real, meaning that something authentic is not dependent on outside ideas or bias. A person who is authentic is transparent about their values and beliefs, that is personal authenticity. People can be authentic by staying true to their personality and values and not giving in to social pressure. In this case, outside influence can align with authenticity if it reflects the person\u2019s values, for example: if they hear an argument about something they\u2019re not convinced about but they agree with the argument and it makes sense with what they believe in, then it is authentic for them to change their minds. An inauthentic person may change their point of view on a specific topic every time they talk to someone different about it, but a person can remain authentic if they change their mind about something they believe in, as long as it\u2019s not against what they really stand for and value. If a person changes their mind during a conversation with the sole intent of appeasing or pleasing someone but without actually believing in what was said, that would be an inauthentic change. Research authenticity is different than personal authenticity but it is complemented by it, meaning that a research authenticity can be enhanced when participants are also authentic. In research, a study is authentic if it is reliable and was made ethically. That is by following research conduct, having an original study\u2013meaning that it is written by the people who conducted and created it; an ample and diverse source\u2013which would be a large group of people of different backgrounds, free of biases\u2013which means that it has no inclination to the researcher\u2019s personal opinions and beliefs; and that is replicable, meaning that it could be done many times again in the same way and get the same results. For example, an experiment could lose authenticity if a researcher didn\u2019t engage in reflexivity\u2013that is, a process of critical self-awareness of how their own cultural values, socio-economic background, political orientation, and other worldviews might impact all stages of their research process and tried to impose their own beliefs on the subjects. But if the person conducting the study does engage in reflexivity, the study will flow better and the experiment will be more even-handed. Personal and research authenticity involves consistency, both internal and external. And that is when personal and research authenticity come together. In the case of personal authenticity, internal consistency is when a person is being true to oneself, to their opinions and what they believe in, which means that while participating in research, a person is maintaining internal consistency by giving genuine answers and sticking to their values and beliefs. Personal external consistency means that a person is being perceived as authentic by others\u2013in this case, by being genuine and persistent with their answers in a study, a person will be perceived as authentic by researchers, other participants, and by those who will later read the study. Similarly to personal authenticity, research authenticity involves internal consistency, which depends on the process of building and conducting the study. So if a study was ethically made, with a diverse group of participants, written and conducted by the same researchers, with no bias, and replicable, then it has internal consistency. Research external consistency relies on how the research is perceived by the academic community\u2013if the reaction of the peers in the community is positively similar, if the majority of the peers believe the study to be reliable\u2013meaning that the study would produce the same results if put into place multiple times\u2013and valid\u2013that is, if the researchers are really measuring what they claim to be\u2013the study will be taken as authentic. Research external consistency is demonstrated when the academic community views the study as reliable, replicable, and valid, confirming its authenticity. These forms of consistency are different, but interconnected as one results in the other. In both cases, internal consistency\u2013whether in personal responses or the study design\u2013shapes external consistency as it shapes how authenticity is perceived by others.\n\n\n2.

I will combine my indicators by giving them assigned weights and averaging them. I will assign a bigger weight to the extremes, which are \"Very Strongly Disagree\" and \"Very Strongly Agree\", and assign a smaller weight to the middle option, \"Neither Agree nor Disagree.\"\n\nSince in this case there is no meaningful zero and the variables are measured on a scale with equal intervals, the level of measurement of the combined numerical representation is interval.\n\n4. I believe that these indicators would be better applied to a survey and to a target population of 19 to 25 year-olds, with no specific background.

These biases impact areas like hiring practices and political representation. Disparities in economic opportunities refer to structural inequality, which focuses on how societal structures shape access to economic opportunities.

A negative emotion can be characterized as when someone feels angry, sad, or anxious. Anger is defined as strong feeling of disgust towards oneself or another person. Disgust is to wish yourself or the other person harm or misfortune. Sadness is characterized as the feeling of being unsatisfied about your own life. Anxiety can be defined as a general feeling of discomfort with oneself, which can spiral into complete despair about what the envious person has done with their life or what is to come. Despair can be defined as the feeling of losing hope. Desire can be characterized as when someone is strongly wishing for something to happen. The degree to which someone is envious can be measured through their reactions to envy; this can manifest as inspiration, passiveness, or confrontation. Inspiration can be defined as when someone decides to take action after a negative experience that does not harm others. Taking action can be defined as an outward reaction. Harm can be defined as hurting someone else or yourself. Hurting someone is defined as causing them pain. When someone is inspired by their envy, they first feel negatively about themselves due to someone having something they do not, and then they decide to take action to obtain this thing as well. An example of being inspired by envy would be if the envious person felt negatively after seeing someone who was in better shape than them, but then decided to eat healthier and go to the gym more. Passiveness can be characterized by when a person decides not take action in a situation when they could. When someone is passive while envious is exemplified by the envious person feeling negatively about themselves because of something another person has, but not taking action. An example of this is when an envious person feels angry because their co-worker was promoted over them, but they do not act upon their envy. Being confrontational can be defined as when someone takes action due to their negative emotions that harms other people. Confrontation due to envy can be exemplified by a physical or verbal confrontation with either the person they are envious of or the third party who awarded the other person the achievement that the envious person desires. Here, the envious person attempts to harm one of those parties, potentially saying something like \"you did not deserve this promotion!\" to the co-worker who was promoted.\u00a0\n\nIndicators and Levels of Measurement:\nAll Questions Measured on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being \"extremely unlikely\" and 5 being \"extremely likely\". The level of measurement for all questions is interval.\u00a0\n\u201cHow likely would you be to exercise more often if you noticed a friend of yours was beginning to look more physically fit than you?\u201d [Inspiration]\n\u201cHow likely would you be to download a dating app after a friend of yours starting dating someone from that same dating app? [Inspiration]\u00a0\n\"A friend of yours has gotten quite skilled at a hobby you've had interest in but never tried. How likely are you to continue\u00a0NOT to try this hobby?\" [Passiveness]\u00a0\n\u201cIf a co-worker is promoted to a job you felt you deserved, how likely are you to choose to continue with your work until the next opportunity arises?\u201d [Passiveness]\n\"A friend begins to date a person whom you've had interest in recently. How likely are you to have an altercation with your friend over this issue?\" [Confrontation]\u00a0\n\u201cIf a peer was awarded for something you wish you were awarded for, how likely are you to let them know you feel they did not deserve that award over you?\"\u00a0 [Confrontation]\n\nCombined Level of Measurement:\nI plan to combine my indicators through addition. There are six indicators, so I'll add each of them together because I prefer addition over other forms of combining the indicators and I think it lends itself well to the interval level of measurement. Each dimension will be weighted equally and the final interval would be 6-30, with 6 being a very unenvious person and 30 being a very envious person ((1-5 scale for each indicator, lowest possible total score of 6 (1x6)\u00a0 and highest possible total score of 30 (5x6)). The level of measurement would still be interval after combining all of the indicators. A sample cumulative score could be 24/30 on the final envy scale.\n\nProcedures:\nI would apply my indicators in the form of a survey. The target population would be done fully via random selection, as I'm looking to see how all types of people express envy. There are no special considerations, and participants will just be instructed to answer the questions honestly then send their answers back once they complete the survey.\u00a0\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1744939687013, "student": {"_id": "67eed96528462e6254493d2a", "uid": "zSSYUItFNFOxXZAN0cbyb5wfUfC3", "email": "jtayl8@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1743706469875, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Joseph Taylor", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

For instance, I had a question about someone going to a pool party: if the other person got a new pool, would you be likely to still go to the pool party even if you wanted their pool before? The chatbot noted that social pressure could influence the decision to attend, which wasn't the focus of my question on a one-to-five scale. \n\nWith the chatbot's input, I refined my questions to better target the specific dimensions and developed a one-to-five scale, which I felt worked best.

In a confrontation scenario, the question might be: 'A friend of yours has started dating someone you're interested in. How likely are you to have an altercation with this friend?' In contrast, the inspiration question could be: 'You notice that a friend of yours has become more physically fit than you. How likely are you to start going to the gym and eating healthier?' Clearly, the inspiration question is not about confrontation; it's about whether you'd be inspired to take action. Meanwhile, the confrontation question directly addresses conflict.\n\nSimilarly, there's the passive scenario: 'If you saw a coworker promoted ahead of you when you felt you deserved it, how likely are you to simply continue your work?' People who choose this answer might be more passive.\n\nIn this way, I believe the scenarios are mutually exclusive. You can't act on inspiration while being passive, and you can't confront someone while being passive. Additionally, I distinguish between inspiration and confrontation: actions inspired by inspiration do not harm others, whereas confrontational actions do. Thus, inspiration and confrontation are mutually exclusive.\n\nOverall, it was important to word the questions carefully to ensure that each scenario was distinct and didn't overlap with others.\""}, {"conversation_id": "68019e61613e7c98b7919a25", "question": "It's great that you've thought carefully about making each scenario distinct to avoid overlap.

I wanted to make sure the questions and indicators I chose fit into the categories and dimensions I discussed in the previous questions. I explained how I came to those dimensions and how I formulated the questions I settled on.\n\nNext, I addressed criterion validity to ensure the questions not only encompass envy but also relate to similar concepts like jealousy. I considered how I could verify this by studying jealousy using different methods, such as experimental lab studies, which I wrote about. Then, I moved on to content validity, which is definitely challenging. It\u2019s difficult to fully encompass an abstract concept like envy, but I felt that the dimensions and indicators I selected would effectively measure it. This is somewhat subjective, and while some people might disagree with my approach, others might agree. We didn't conduct any research on scientifically accepted dimensions for envy, but I put considerable thought into the ones I came up with, ensuring they incorporate the emotional reactions to envy. I reviewed the indicators carefully to accurately measure them, ensuring each dimension had two or three different indicators.\n\nIn terms of reliability, I considered conducting an interval-based test. I believe this is a great way to ensure reliability while maintaining a consistent one-to-five scale. Consistently asking questions like \"How likely are you to do this?\" limits variance and confusion for the participants. I also considered using the split-half method to check question reliability by choosing one question from each dimension and comparing it to others to ensure similar and reliable responses.\n\nAdditionally, for further reliability testing, instead of using the test-retest method\u2014which might not be effective because participants could remember their previous responses\u2014I would employ the parallel forms test. This involves rewriting the survey questions while keeping them similar and maintaining the same scale, thereby ensuring that the survey consistently measures the same dimensions.

External circumstance is an event that occurs outside of the self, but has some sort of direct or indirect impact on oneself. Interest is defined as the frequency with which an individual seeks new information about something. Second, low levels of concern, meaning an individual does not associate it with any strong positive or negative emotion, and does not consider the circumstance to have high levels of importance. A strong emotion is defined as a psychological state characterized by intense positive or negative feelings, like distress or elation. Importance, in this case, is defined as the degree to which an individual considers something worth paying attention to by themselves and those around them. Third, low motivation to interact with the external circumstance one is apathetic about. Motivation is defined by an individual\u2019s desire to take action. In this case, taking action is defined as an individual using their own resources\u2013like money, labor, or time\u2013to create direct or indirect change to the world around them.

This concept is intertwined with the dimensions of being self conscious, and societal influence. Self consciousness is when you are nervous about what people think about you or your actions. Often, people feel anxious when they think they are being judged, and the type of nervousness you feel regarding your body is whether people think your body is too big, or a unique feature you have that is unflattering. A unique feature is something that you feel most people dont have. An example of this is a birthmark or a physical disability. Often self consciousness can lead to critical self talk which is a subcomponent of self consciousness. Critical self talk means having a negative voice in your head that makes you feel that there is something wrong with you or something you have done. And, societal influence is when groups around you make you believe something is better because of a general idea that is believed to be true by a majority. An example of this is buying something because it is popular. People often absorb unconsciously what is happening around them but do end up comparing themselves to eachother because of social influence. A subcomponent of self consciousness is perceived ideas. Perceived ideas can be the way that you think about someone or something based on limited knowledge. This can often be seen in what is trending. Therefore, it makes you believe some choices or ideas are better than others. Related to body image dissatisfaction people are influenced by what bodies are seen as worthy. Worthy meaning that society sees you as admirable, you receive extra attention, and are more accepted.\u00a0\n\n2.\u00a0\n\nTo what extent do you agree with this statement?

I think they will all be weighted equally and determined at the end based on how high or low the individual scored. I asked 8 questions and when the question is interval it has a number associated with each on that would be what i would add to the total. and if it is ratio it would be converted into range like 5-10 hours 11-15 hours and so on and each would have a value to add after creating the range. There are 23 possible points for the interval questions, and with the ratio question, I would need to create a range and find a numerical value to add to the overall point system.\u00a0\n\n4. I was imagining that this would be done through a survey. I believe the best target population for this survey would be teenage girls between 13 and 19 years old. I would ask them to answer the survey and just be upfront and say this is an anonymous survey about body image dissatisfaction. because they would be self reporting I would hope to do the test-retest method and ask the same or similar question on a different day within the week to see if the results were similar.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1744941942830, "student": {"_id": "67edc6e7dfb5c1f3841f4026", "uid": "gg0mwOR50hemyr8k8vK8Xwu14Of1", "email": "aletin@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1743636199834, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Ava Letinich", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Body image dissatisfaction, in my opinion, affects many young people, especially young women. Drawing from my personal experiences, I recognize that critical self-thinking, negative self-talk, and societal expectations significantly contribute to this issue. Social media, for instance, makes it incredibly easy to compare ourselves to others. If you don't look a certain way, you begin to feel unworthy, and this mindset exacerbates body image dissatisfaction.\n\nI highlighted the word \"worthy\" because it aptly represents the core element I wanted to emphasize. In society, we often base our worthiness on our appearance and behavior rather than our actions, words, or contributions. We focus on how we think people perceive us, which is why I chose to use this term to describe societal influence. Often, we don't feel worthy of love and belonging if we don't meet certain appearance standards, which can lead to harmful effects on body image.

I think that, often in social media, it's about individual influencers or consumers. It's really difficult to get major platforms to stop certain practices, especially when they are profitable. I believe we need to limit young people's and children's access to social media. For example, TikTok has done a better job at taking down content that promotes hateful body images or eating disorders. You can report such content, and there are often comments that critique or explain why certain unrealistic body types are not acceptable. Young women, especially, should not expect to look a certain way because, for example, influencers like Alex Earl, who have been open about undergoing procedures like lip fillers and breast augmentation, demonstrate that their appearances are not entirely natural. \n\nTherefore, while there isn't much control over social media platforms themselves, it's important to be mindful of what we, as individuals, consume.

Through my survey, I wanted to focus on questions that correlate with how you perceive yourself, how you feel about your own body, and how you think you're being perceived, as this perception is part of societal influence.\n\nA beneficial aspect of my survey is the plan to conduct a test-retest reliability method. I would like to take the same group of individuals, give them a survey, then have them return a few days later to complete a similar survey with similar or identical questions to see if the results vary and to confirm consistency. Then, I would apply this process to a different group of individuals to see if the results are consistent.\n\nIf there were to be a hypothesis for this study, it might concern the age at which young women and teenage girls are most affected by body image dissatisfaction. Regarding the term I forgot earlier, I believe I was trying to refer to a \"reliability\" method.\n\nThis survey concept is probably similar to surveys we\u2019ve conducted before. In my group communication class, we did a similar exercise today, which reminded me of this idea. It involves administering surveys and asking similar questions repeatedly to compare results.\n\nSince my questions are based on interval and ratio scales, I would take the numerical values associated with them, either averaging them or totaling them, to determine the score. For example, a score of twenty-three might indicate the highest level of dissatisfaction with one's body, while zero would indicate satisfaction.

Beauty is an expectation maintained and changing with human beliefs. It is a thing both internally and externally more positively perceived and appealing to others. Beauty is a societal ideal, something that influences how humans hope to present themselves to conform to what is put on them. Beauty has the following dimensions. Firstly is the emotional dimension. In this context beauty is perceived through the human connections and personality. Human connections refer to the depth and quality of connections humans form with each other. Personality is encompassed by things such as kindness(the amount of care shown to others through verbal and physical expression), conversational ability (the quality of verbal expression to communicate with others) and humor(the quality of amusing others and yourself) and emotional expression(the quality of understanding others through intentional behaviors and thoughtfulness towards the needs of others). Society prefers humans who are capable of putting others at ease. There is the physical dimension, in which we consider one's face, body, and movements. Facial beauty contains symmetry( both sides appearing the same) and proportions (the size of your facial features such as your eyes, nose, and forehead). Body beauty regards the shape and size of your physical features such as your torso and legs. Beauty of movements regards posture(how strait and forward you hold yourself), and your walk(the way your move your legs, hold your face, and move your arms when moving). Movement reflects societal ideals of physical strength, physical health and self assurance (the way in which one presents themselves to society). These are determined to be beautiful by societal definitions, which change through the centuries. This lens focuses on how human ideas and opinions influences the way humans hope to present themselves physically and emotionally.\n\nemotional dimension indicators: On a scale of 1-8, (1 being least important and 8 being most important), rate the importance of the following emotional indicators in society\u2019s standards of beauty:\nKindness (the amount of care shown to others through verbal and physical expression)\n\nHumor (the quality of amusing others and yourself)\n\nconversational ability (the quality of verbal expression to communicate with others)\n\nemotional expression(the quality of understanding and projecting one's thoughts through intentional behaviors)\n\nPhysical dimension indicators: On a scale of 1-8, (1 being least important and 8 being most important) rate the importance of the following physical features in society\u2019s standards of beauty.\n\nFacial symmetry (both sides appearing the same)\n\nproportions on face (the size of your facial features such as your eyes, nose, and forehead)\u00a0\n\nSize of your torso (how long it is in proportion to your body)\n\nLength of your legs (how long they are in proportion to your body)\u00a0\n\nposture(how straight and forward you hold yourself)\n\nyour walk(the way you hold yourself while walking) \u00a0\n\nEach of my indicators are ordinal. Indicators are ranked to be more or less important. There are not equal intervals between my variables.\u00a0\n\nI would use a survey to get my responses. I would target adults that are eighteen and older as it is easier and they have a better perception of societal beauty.

Empathy is the ability of an individual to display three main dimensions: understanding, perspective taking, and emotional relation. First, understanding is the process by which one person recognizes and makes meaning of what someone else is thinking or feeling through interpretation. This includes both verbal communication (like spoken words) and nonverbal communication (like body language and context). Second, perspective refers to the way an individual makes sense of the world around them, often shaped by their background and experiences. Perspective taking can manifest in the active ability of an individual to adopt another person's point of view to gain understanding of a situation. Finally, emotional relation involves connecting with or sharing in another person\u2019s emotional experiences and providing support. Sharing is the creation of a mutual understanding between two or more people. Mutual understanding is when two individuals clearly make sense of what the other is thinking or feeling. Emotional experiences refer to internal feelings that respond to stimuli, internal or external events that capture someone\u2019s attention.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\n\nDimension 1: Understanding\u00a0\n\nIndicator 1: Awareness of personal impact on other individuals (Self-Reported)\nA questionnaire using the likert scale (1 - Strongly Disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - Neutral, 4 - Agree, 5- Strongly Agree) would be administered.\u00a0\nQuestion: \u201cI always think about how my words or actions might affect others\u201d.

The attributes I identified included, for instance, considering how perspective-taking relates to empathy. I asked myself how someone demonstrates empathy in everyday life. Acknowledging individual differences in background and experiences is crucial because when you put yourself in someone else's shoes, you also have to recognize\u2014and my anthropology minor is going to show here\u2014that everybody\u2019s perspective is different, and everyone has a unique lens through which they create their mental map of reality and their worldview.

It's beneficial to highlight this question and encourage people to truly consider it.

This is obviously the easiest aspect to achieve when examining a study like this. However, the questions I asked and the indicators I chose reflect society's basic understanding of empathy, so that part was relatively straightforward.\n\nThe second aspect of validity I considered was discriminant validity. This was also somewhat easier for me to grasp because I find it more intuitive to compare a measurement against its opposite to ensure the scores aren't related. However, it creates the challenge of ensuring that overall, when measuring, you compare it against something related. For empathy, that comparable construct might be kindness or compassion. If these related constructs produce similar measurements, how do they align?\n\nIn terms of reliability, I found this aspect somewhat simpler because internal consistency indicates that when comparing each indicator with one another, they should all yield relatively similar scores since they relate to the same concept of empathy. When assessing the indicators I selected in terms of reliability, it was evident that perspective-taking and understanding, as examined through my conversation with the chatbot, overlapped to some extent. I believe I was able to delineate and differentiate between them, making it easier to ensure we are measuring the intended construct rather than an unrelated one, tying back to validity.\n\nRegarding the reliability aspect, if, for some reason, the scores of those three indicators did not align, it would indicate a problem with one of the indicators. In such a case, I would need to replace it with a more suitable option for the study."}, {"conversation_id": "6801b688613e7c98b791c1ff", "question": "You made an interesting point about using internal consistency to ensure reliability.

For example, it told me that my clarity and precision need work, advising me to watch for overlaps in cells and concepts. One of the things the chatbot suggested was regarding the term \"I want to help them\" for my second indicator question concerning emotional relations. It advised me that this phrasing could blend motivation and behavior, even when we're not necessarily testing both. So, instead of \"I want to help them,\" I changed the wording of the question to \"When someone is upset, my first instinct is to help them.\" Initially, it was the other way around: \"My first instinct was to help them,\" and then I changed it to \"I want to help them.\" By revising the wording, I found improvement.

The three dimensions of group cohesion are communication style, collaboration, and group environment. Communication within a cohesive group includes both verbal and non-verbal cues, or interaction through spoken words and gestures such as finger pointing or nodding. They communicate positively, this means that each member is polite and nonjudgmental. To be polite means each member speaks without interrupting others. To be non judgemental means to consider all group member\u2019s ideas while not interrupting with personal biases. Collaboration within a cohesive group means every group member contributes to the generation of ideas and works to build on existing suggestions. This includes group participation through asking questions and being open to receiving feedback. Feedback is a suggestion that builds upon a pre existing suggestion. The environment of a group is important because a cohesive group environment allows the group to more easily complete tasks. A cohesive group environment is a space where all group members feel comfortable with one another. This means that they feel like they can voice their opinions and ideas without the fear of being criticized. When these three dimensions are met it allows a group to work cohesively and communicate effectively to complete a shared goal.\n\nYour final set of indicators and their associated levels of measurement\nWhile working in a group, I treat all members equally. Options: 1. Strongly agree, 2. slightly agree, 3. neutral, 4. slightly disagree, 5. strongly disagree - communication style\nIn the group, I treated all members with respect when working with others Options: 1.

Options: 1. Strongly agree, 2. slightly agree, 3. neutral, 4. slightly disagree, 5. strongly disagree - collaboration\nHow you are going to combine those indicators and what the level of measurement of the combined numerical representation will be.\n\nWhen combining my indicators, I am going to add and average them. In this type of measurement with the Likert scale, it would be best to keep the scores on a scale of 1-5 this allows the score to be interpreted on a general scale of 1. Strongly agree to 5. Strongly disagree. In. general, it is easier to interpret a score that is 3.2 rather than 26 given the context. Since 5. is labeled strongly agree and consistent throughout the study, a score of 3.2 for example would easily express a slightly agree standpoint. This is easily identifiable compared to a random number of 26 for example, which would have to be interpreted on a further level.\u00a0\n\nThe level of measurement of the combined numerical representation is an interval Likert scale. This means there is a 1-5 scale from 1. Strongly agree to 5. Strongly disagree. The study I conducted is consistent throughout and is only an interval measurement and easy to interpret on all basis of the study.\u00a0\n\nThe procedures for applying these indicators for data collection.\n\nA researcher would apply these indicators through an online survey, which makes it easier for all members to remain anonymous. The dimensions and indicators I came up with are best identified through self-report and peer review. This collects data from members within the group. An experiment would not be applicable, because there are no variables to be manipulated throughout this process. It is only based on observation and reflection of group cohesion.\u00a0\n\nThe target population for this study would be various group dynamics. This can include groups like college student who work on group projects who are trying to measure whether or not they were cohesive. It is important that groups be cohesive in these two types of environments for example because there are higher stakes. In a work setting, they may need to complete an important project, or a school environment grades may be hindered due to the lack of cohesion within the group.\u00a0\n\nInstructions that would be given to participants would occur when measuring the cohesiveness of a group after a task is performed. This includes a task of some sort or completing a project. They would be told to be as honest when answering the questions. When evaluating a specific person- like 'person 1' throughout the study, it is important to remain consistent and report based on observation throughout the study not opinion of a specific person. Be sure to remain as unbiased as possible without including a personal relationship or connection to a certain person. Lastly, the survey will remain anonymous, so there are no right or wrong answers when answering these questions. The survey is completely confidential, which is part of the informed consent process and all information will be kept in a safe place. They will then be given the survey and be told to submit it once they complete it answer the questions to the best of their ability.\u00a0", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1744943797896, "student": {"_id": "67ed9ec328462e6254493ca0", "uid": "etm6kAHUhtShU98GTcQfXP2WxJl1", "email": "maceykim@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1743625923986, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Macey Keiko Kim", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Burnout is a symptom of overworking and exhausting the body and mind. Burnout consists of the lack of interest, which means the person will have a less-intrigued reaction or weak desire to engage in a task they are usually more willing/inclined to do or explore, as in expanding their knowledge on the subject or doing more of the task. It also includes the lack of motivation. Motivation is the mental convincing in various ways, such as thinking about the consequence of not finishing the task, or how much better they will feel once they complete the task, etc.., that lets the person start doing things, the lack of it means the person is taking more time and mental effort to encourage themselves get started on the task they like, or is an obligation, something they must do, often within a time limit, such as school work. Another dimension that makes up burnout is mental fatigue, which means it is hard for the person to focus on working on a specific task. It takes the person longer to understand, retain, and apply the concepts they learn compared to usual. It also means the person desires rest and entertainment, such as watching a movie, consuming social media, or sleeping, rather than actively using their brain to solve tasks or dealing with work that requires logical thinking, reasoning, creativity, such as school assignments, lecture watching, working on a project at work, etc.\n\n2.

Just like physical exhaustion, when you are mentally tired, it's hard to move, think, focus, or be passionate. That's why I believe, for validity and reliability of measurements for this operational definition, I try to use different forms and levels of measurement and various types of questions to thoroughly probe and ask the subject in different ways. This approach prevents them from recognizing a pattern, and varying the format can make their answers and overall feelings more solidified and precise. I use ratio measurement to determine the concrete number of hours or minutes they spent on a task before losing interest. This is paired with interval measurement, which assesses how much they relate to the statement, 'If I feel burned out, I am not interested in this task at all.' I can then compare how much they agree with this statement to the amount of time they indicated in the ratio measurement and examine the correlation between them.

Final Conceptual Definition\n\nForgiveness is a process in which a person who has been harmed makes a deliberate or natural shift away from holding negative thoughts, emotions, or intentions toward the person who caused the harm. It does not require excusing the offense, forgetting what happened, or repairing the relationship. Instead, forgiveness involves three interrelated internal changes, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral, that can occur together or independently. Emotional forgiveness is the reduction or release of intense negative emotions like anger (a reactive emotional response to perceived wrongdoing), bitterness (a lasting sense that the harm was unfair and unresolved), and hatred (a desire to see the other person suffer). This emotional shift moves toward emotional neutrality, where the person no longer feels disturbed, reactive, or emotionally activated when recalling the event or the person involved. Cognitive forgiveness is the mental shift in how the person interprets the offender or the offense. This may involve re-evaluating the person\u2019s motivations (the internal or external reasons behind their behavior, whether intentional or unintentional) or adopting a more balanced view that sees the offender as a complex individual capable of both harm and growth. Behavioral forgiveness is reflected in the person\u2019s intentional change in outward responses. This includes avoiding retaliation (deliberately choosing not to return harm), maintaining polite interaction (respectful communication such as greeting, listening, or civil behavior), or re-engaging socially (willingness to resume a neutral or positive relationship if the person desires it). While these dimensions may unfold in different orders, they often influence one another\u2014for example, cognitive reframing may reduce emotional intensity, which can open the door for behavioral change. Altogether, forgiveness is a flexible yet identifiable process of transformation that reduces the mental and emotional hold of the offense.\n\n\n\n\n2. Final Set of Indicators and Their Associated Levels of Measurement\n\nDimension 1: Emotional Forgiveness\n\n\u201cI still feel angry when I think about the person who hurt me.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\u201cI feel emotionally neutral, calm and unbothered, when I think about the offense.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\u201cI experience bitterness when I recall the situation.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\nDimension 2: Cognitive Forgiveness\n\n\u201cI have tried to understand the reasons behind the other person\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\u201cI have re-evaluated my assumptions about the person who hurt me.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\u201cI have tried to view the situation from the other person\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\nDimension 3: Behavioral Forgiveness\n\n\u201cIf I saw the person who hurt me, I would be open to greeting them politely.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\u201cI have not done anything to get back at the person who hurt me.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\u201cI would be willing to have a short, respectful conversation with the person if the situation allowed.\u201d\n\u2192 Interval\n\n\n\n\n3. How I Will Combine the Indicators and the Level of Measurement\n\nTo represent forgiveness as a single numerical score, I will average all nine indicators across the three dimensions. Averaging is appropriate because each item is measured on the same 7-point Likert scale, and this method gives equal weight to each indicator. I do not plan to weight any one dimension more than the others, as all three are equally important based on my conceptual definition. The level of measurement for the combined numerical representation is interval, since it is derived from averaging interval-level Likert scale items.\n\n\n\n\n4. Procedures for Applying the Indicators for Data Collection\n\nI will use a survey method to apply these indicators. Participants will complete an online self-report questionnaire. The target population is college students who have experienced interpersonal conflict.\n\nParticipants will be asked to recall a time when someone hurt or wronged them, and to keep that situation in mind as they respond to the forgiveness-related items. Instructions will emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers and that participants should answer based on how they currently feel, think, and act in relation to that event.\n\nAll items will use a 7-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cStrongly Agree.\u201d A brief content warning will be included to prepare participants for reflecting on emotionally sensitive topics. The survey will be anonymous to protect participant privacy and encourage honest responses.

Conceptual definition:\u00a0\nFriendship is a feeling of care, which includes closeness and intimacy, and trust, which includes reliability and consistency, that one feels toward another individual that is not romantic but is more than the feelings one would feel toward a stranger. Care involves wondering and inquiring about a person\u2019s well-being, like their health or struggles, which is defined later, and generally having the ability to be close with someone. Closeness in friendship, a sub dimension of care, refers to how able someone is to be intimate with another person. Intimacy in this case refers to actions that would otherwise be uncomfortable for a person who is not close to someone to perform, like hugging, telling secrets, or asking for help or advice, especially in times of physical or emotional struggle. Struggles are things in a person\u2019s life they perceive to be difficult when thought about and can be physical or emotional. Physical and emotional struggle are feelings created by tangible issues, like some work that needs to be completed, or feelings created by internal issues, like grieving after losing a family member. Trust in friendship is the idea that a person\u2019s friend will be fair and honest with them, like keeping secrets, avoiding deception, and being reliable when needed. Deception includes lying, but also hiding truths from someone, or communicating information to someone in a way that will cause an expected, usually angry, sad, or surprised reaction, for one\u2019s own benefit. Reliability in this case is the idea that someone will be consistent in being asked for and giving help, and that their beliefs or personality will not change suddenly. Consistency, an important sub dimension of reliability, is the idea that someone will act in a manner that befits a previous, established actions and beliefs, as far as their friend believes, anyway, and will not change such things without reason or spontaneously. Beliefs can include a person\u2019s cultural customs, personal likes and dislikes, or topics they show more or less emotion toward, like how much they like specific genres or media. Cultural customs refer to the unique beliefs or traditions a person is granted by their family or community. Personal likes and dislikes refer to their personally developed positive or negative emotions toward various topics like food, school, or sports. Someone\u2019s personality is their consistent manner in terms of how they handle their emotions, beliefs and interests. A romantic relationship can involve parts of friendship, but will also most likely involve deeper intimacy, like sexual acts. Feelings toward a stranger do not involve the same care and trust that one would show to a friend, such as avoiding intimate acts and not being as aware of a person\u2019s reliability and the traits involved in consistency. Uncomfortability refers to feelings of nervousness or the feeling that something possibly wrong is occurring, like feeling or acting on the desire to move away from an unknown individual who touches any part of your body without permission.\n\nOperational definition: \nAll survey questions using the Likert Scale are interval measurements.\n\nCare: I feel that my friend cares about my wellbeing: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\u00a0\n\nCare: I feel my friend will worry about me if they believe I am unhappy: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\u00a0\n\nCloseness: I feel my friend would not question me if I asked them about their feelings in a conversation: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\u00a0\n\nCloseness: I can tell my friend I care about them without them questioning why: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\u00a0\n\nCloseness: My friend is okay with telling me secrets they would not tell strangers: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\n\nTrust: I expect my friend to not tell my secrets to anyone else without permission: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\u00a0\n\nTrust: I can talk to my friend expecting them to not lie to me in a conversation: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\n\nTrust: My friend would not purposefully hide information from me if I asked them a question:\u00a0 Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\n\nReliability: I can ask my friend for help with my work and expect to get help: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\n\nReliability: It is important my friend knows I will help them if they need help: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5)\n\nConsistency: I can assume my friend\u2019s response to an event based on my understanding of their personality: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\n\nConsistency: I can think of a tradition, like celebrating a holiday or getting certain food with me, that my friend has enjoyed several times: Strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5).\n\nWhat is your ethnicity? (Survey taker can place anything they want) (Nominal)\n\nWhat is your age? (Survey taker can place anything they want) (Nominal)\n\nWhat is your gender? (Survey taker can place anything they want) (Nominal)\n\n3. My plan would be to add all the scores together to see how high the number is out of the currently possible 60 points. The closer the score is to the total amount of points, the more people believe these concepts align with the concept of friendship. However, each category would also be individually added together to see how high they score, as if the trust questions consistently score low scores, then we could interpret that people don't generally associate it with friendship, compared to if care consistently scored high scores. It would also give special weight to each category, as if they were only combined into one score, it would be hard to gauge what topics were especially important to participants. The total added scores would be interval measurement, as the difference between a 10 and 20 score and a 30 and 40 score would be the same, and it's impossible to get a 0 on the survey. The questions at the end regarding's people identity are to show how diverse the survey was, rather than to research how friendship changes between identities.\n\n4.\u00a0This would be a survey. I would want the target population to be wide, considering several different ages, like teens and people in their early 20s, ~30-year-olds, ~50-year-olds, along with men and women, and people from different cultural backgrounds, ethnicities, and races. This would create a wide sample of people with different thoughts of friendship, which then would make it so the dimensions that score high points are seen as a consistent part of defining friendship across identities. Participants would be asked to do the survey without communicating with other participants about the questions. In the case that many different races or ethnicities are involved in the research, the surveys would be printed in numerous languages befitting those taking them. The test would be clearly explained as measuring people's thoughts on their friendships, though it would not tell them what categories the questions fall into and would be expected to be done in one sitting. They will be told that their answers will only be used if they consent for their information to be used, and all research participants would have to be 18 or over.\n\nThe test would be taken online or in-person at a research facility by a certain number of participants who agree to take the test. A researcher would be in the room they take the test in but would not be watching them take the test and would only be necessary for if they have questions which participants would be informed of. To choose participants, posters would be placed across various neighborhoods of Seattle explaining the friendship survey and a number would be callable so people can learn more and join the study. Social media posts on Seattle-specific social media sites, like R/Seattle, would also be used to invite people to the survey. The survey can be taken for up to two weeks after the posters and social media posts are placed, and there would not be a limit on how many can join the study if they are applicable. Everyone is allowed to take the survey once, and every person would be given a specific number they write on their survey to make sure they do not take it again. Their information would not be seen by anyone but researchers, and the expected safeguards for their digital information, like password-protected files, would be used.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1744949750941, "student": {"_id": "67ecab6528462e6254493c86", "uid": "Im9tWshsT2S8IRYtQsus20ojbDk2", "email": "carlo314@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1743563621489, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Carlo Vargas Aguirre", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

Intimacy involves a genuine physical closeness and ability to be near someone, which is part of the definition of closeness. Intimacy requires that physical closeness, something that care doesn't inherently possess unless it's explained as a subsection of intimacy. That's why I like to separate the two.\n\nIntimacy also includes the ability to ask questions or talk about topics that might be uncomfortable to discuss with a stranger or someone you don't know well. This aspect again falls under the concept of care and is why I distinguish between the two. I believe both care and intimacy are parts of friendship, but care involves much more than just the ability to ask personal questions or be physically close.

If you can't rely on someone to be consistent in how they act, or if you can't rely on them to keep your secrets or do what you expect them to do, such as not sharing your secrets, then you can't trust them with that information.

Everyone is taught different concepts of what it means to keep a secret. In some cases, a person might be told a secret and believe it is reasonable to share that secret with family members or very close friends, as part of their cultural belief that these people deserve to be aware of such secrets. In some cultures, it's considered normal for these people to be aware of the secrets. There are many cultures where you are not supposed to keep secrets from elders or perceived superiors. This cultural perspective can certainly influence a person's reliability. For example, they might not see it as a problem to tell a secret to someone they believe should know, without even asking if it's appropriate for them to have that information.\n\nAs a result, trustworthiness can vary greatly between cultures involved in a friendship. Some people believe that a secret should be strictly protected and that no one else should know about it until explicit permission is given. Conversely, others believe that a secret can be reasonably shared with those they feel should be informed, regardless of whether permission was granted.

Obviously, someone you trust shouldn't be telling you lies, but they also shouldn't be hiding information from you in a conversation. Additionally, they shouldn't convey information in a way designed to provoke a specific reaction. For instance, if they want you to become angry and are aware of a situation, they shouldn't share that information in a manner intended to make you angry. This would be using their intimacy and knowledge of you to be deceptive and untrustworthy.\n\nRegarding care, it is described as being intimate and willing to do things that might otherwise make someone uncomfortable. This means that if you care about someone, you would care about their well-being, their struggles, and the work they are doing. I think this would also mean, in most cases, that you feel those emotions yourself. If you sense that your friend is unhappy or struggling, you would probably experience some kind of emotion reflecting that, some degree of discomfort, even if it's not something you're actively acting upon. You'll still have some level of empathy with them because you understand them.\n\nI believe the questions posed demonstrate this idea: that they will care about your well-being and reflect your emotions.

Some people think trust is conditional, or, like some others believe, they perceive a secret can be revealed to those they see as cultural superiors, like elders. They believe elders should be aware of any information you have without keeping it hidden. In terms of care, there are some cultures where friends are expected to have a much deeper connection, showing much more care for others. Meanwhile, other cultures may have ideas that tend to separate people a bit more, yet still believe they care about each other because, to them, that's what care is.\n\nEither way, the fact that some people perceive care as a much more intense or less intense emotion and trust as something that can be more loose or very strict definitely exists. These differences exist between cultures and will affect survey results, as people will interpret the importance of these aspects in friendship differently.

Although this is arguably a prevalent issue, I don't see it as such due to my personal identity, but rather because it is an actual issue. The chatbot gathers and interprets information more efficiently than a human could over years. This enables it to identify consistent or significant issues that aren't solely based on its own perception. Instead of using its own viewpoints to determine right or wrong, it suggests considering different perspectives, drawing from the knowledge and experiences it has accumulated.

Imagination was really rough to explain; defining it without simply trying to describe what imagination is to someone is tough because everyone imagines things differently. I have a very vivid imagination, so trying to explain how that works in a definition with indicators was really difficult. Once I got an idea, I kind of just ran with it because I was struggling with that one.\n\nThe thought process, on the other hand, is quite simple; it's just how your brain works. It's like step one, step two, step three, step four. I mean, there are branches to it, but I would say that thought process, especially when it comes to imagination and creativity, is just, you know, when someone asks you a question. The first thing you think of is your first step, and that's where you run from there. For the indicators for that, it was easy; it was just like, how many steps did you have? Did you have multiple sites or subsections of steps? Just stuff like that.\n\nAnd then, how did you ensure their validity and reliability when ensuring creativity? I think I mentioned it in there, but for reliability, the retest was a pretty good way to explain it, and so was the other one. For retesting, I mean, if the same participants returned and did a different ad for a different product and their scores matched up, obviously it's reliable. For validity, I talked about the idea of taking, you know, the top three or the top person who scores the highest on the creativity list and showing their ad to advertising professionals and having them judge it. If those people, who do it for work, were like, \"Oh yeah, I really like that, that's super valid,\" then it basically ensures validity because that's what those people do for work, it's probably what they have a degree in, and it's professional for them.

You know that you can talk with them about issues and know that they will work with you and stay if things are difficult. You should believe that this person would never intentionally cause harm to you or another person. Belief in reliability means that you believe they are unchanging in their commitments and have proven themself to be a person you can count on. Trust means that you believe the information that they share and that you believe that they would not lie. Willingness to be vulnerable means that you should be able to purposefully reveal facts about yourself, feelings, and values without fear of judgment and with the intention of building a deeper connection. You should believe that you will be supported in every way possible and that you feel positive feelings around this person on a level that you would not feel with a stranger. Trust is built on a shared connection where you share a deep understanding of this person and their feelings, and do not need to always ask for clarification on their feelings because you already know. Moral alignment means that you and the person share similar beliefs and values about what is right and wrong and about lying and honesty.

Clout can be addressed through: Wealth, a person\u2019s overall net worth and access to resources. Political influence, the ability to change specifically how people vote on laws and in elections. And following in the media, the number of people who look to them for help in making daily decisions because they are aware of who and what a person does.

Always likely\n\n3.\u00a0\n\nFirst I would break down each dimension indicator into its own separate category, wealth, political influence, and media following. I do think that while the three dimensions play into each other, breaking it down into categories could better suit my concept of clout because clout can vary based on a certain dimension more than another. \u00a0I do not think my theory suggests that each of the three dimensions are equally weighted either. For example it is possible for someone to have a lot of clout in terms of wealth, but lack it in political influence.\n\nWealth: I used the interval scale from 1-7 for a majority of my indicators so I would be able to average these scores out relatively easily. However I also used open ended questions, so I would need to convert those answers onto a 1-7 scaled in order to get one standardized score. Based on the data that I collected I would most likely average out the scores and assign a 1-7 value for each of them. From there I could add them up to get a single standard score.\n\nPolitical influence: I used the interval scale from 1-7 for all indicators in this so I would be able to average the scores out relatively easily. I believe that all of these indicators weigh the same and because they build off each other I would just average the scores to find my single standard score for political influence.\u00a0\n\nMedia Following: I used the interval scale from 1-7 for all of my indicators however some of my questions were directly paired together. To make sure that I am creating an accurate reflection in my single score, I would average up the scores based on what the question was asking. I would pair confidence levels together, and then from there I would pair how influential their confidence in identifying would be.\u00a0\n\n4.\u00a0\n\nA researcher could apply these indicators to get a general sense of how much clout the average person believes that they have. They could also apply these indicators to get information on the level of clout a specific targeted individual may have.\u00a0\n\nMost likely an indicator would just put these questions into the form of a survey that would be self-report and would best be done with complete anonymity to reduce social desirability. The target population for this survey would most likely be people who are knowledgeable about their personal finances, people who are familiar with the United States political system, and people who often participate in some form of media. The instructions given to each participant would be to \"Fill out the response to the best of your ability without using any outside sources. If there are additional instructions please be sure to carefully read them and follow them to the best of your abilities.\"\n\nOne special consideration that I would mention is how every question before it asks questions about recognition and, focuses on the clout of the person taking the survey, while the final two indicators are related to their perceived clout about another person.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1744956683892, "student": {"_id": "67ef14c628462e6254493d31", "uid": "Ndaoi2QWlaPl4TdchYUGYybUoo13", "email": "lucasl55@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1743721670734, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Lucas Lee", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

It's different for a lot of people, but they will understand the things that make it either good or bad. For example, love and something culturally different, like marriage, are often associated.

Of course, even without cultural contexts, people will understand what it feels like, what it means, and what the important parts of having a relationship with somebody are.

Emotion refers to a person\u2019s feelings, usually in response to a situation. Emotional weight means emotion that specifically holds importance to a person, typically attached to someone or something. This emotion isn\u2019t inherently good or bad. Three dimensions of grief are complex emotional reasoning, loss, and physical toil. Complex emotional reasoning essentially means difficulty processing a variety of emotions. Difficulty means that something is hard for someone to do. Processing means breaking down thoughts in a way that a person can understand themselves. Variety means a wide range. This could include sadness, anger, confusion, etc. Complex emotional reasoning is a dimension of grief because it affects how a person acts and thinks. Grief also entails loss, which means an absence of something or someone that affects the person negatively. Negative refers to an outcome that hurts a person. Loss is a dimension for grief because it directly connects to the context of a person\u2019s actions, emotions, and situation. Physical toil means the effect of pain on your body. In relation to physical toil, pain means that something hurts your body separate from feelings. Many times, grief physically affects a person negatively because their body usually changes in response. This includes rapidly losing hair, weight, etc. This could also be internal body changes such as fatigue or joint pain. Physical toil encompasses both internal and external pain. These three dimensions are often connected and can happen simultaneously. For instance, experiencing a loss of someone important can cause a person to be confused and make them feel nauseous at the same time. Nauseous in this case refers to an upset stomach that makes a person feel like throwing up. Complex emotional reasoning, loss, and physical toil also operate separately from each other as they cover different components of how a person experiences grief. Grief is not a linear experience, so people may struggle with one component at a time. For instance, tangibly experiencing a loss may occur at a different time than feeling physical toil. The three dimensions of grief can affect a person\u2019s social life, behavior, and lifestyle. These are outcomes of the dimension rather than dimensions themselves.\u00a0\n\n2)\u00a0Indicators:\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being 'strongly\u00a0 disagree' and 7 being 'strongly agree,' answer the following\n\nWhen I have experienced a situation with grief, I feel different emotions that I have rarely previously felt\u00a0 (Complex emotional reasoning) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nWhen I have experienced a situation with grief, I spend more time in the day to process my feelings (Complex emotional reasoning) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nWhen I have experienced a situation with grief, I feel confused about the amount of emotions I feel (Complex emotional reasoning) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nWhen I have experienced grief, I feel unable to bring that absent person or object back in my life (loss) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nWhen facing loss in a situation of grief, I feel the emotional absence of the specific person or object everyday (loss) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nWhen I have experienced grief, the direct absence of the lost person or object has directly affected my behavior (loss) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nMy physical health, referencing internal body health, has worsened since experiencing a situation with grief (Physical toil) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nMy physical health, referencing external body health, has worsened since experiencing a situation with grief (Physical toil) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\nI feel physical body pain when I experience a situation with grief (Physical toil) - Likert Scale, Interval\n\n3) For the concept of grief, I designed three indicators using a Likert scale. People would pick between 1-7 how strongly they believed a certain statement relating to an indicator. Because I designed each indicator with the same number scale, no indicator is weighted more than another. This is also because each indicator contains the same amount of statements. To combine my indicators to represent a single numerical representation of my concept, I will average the scores for each indicator. That way, I can measure how strongly each person resonates with a certain dimension, and can compare and contrast different indicators. The level of measurement of the combined numerical representation is interval.\n\n4) The researcher would apply these indicators through a survey. Since the indicators utilize a Likert scale, a survey is most appropriate. The target population could would be any demographic that experiences grief. This can be found in certain resource areas and settings such as grief counseling, local clinics, hospitals, etc. The instructions that would be given to participants is to fill out the survey as honest as possible. Researchers should also emphasize the confidentiality in this survey process in order to make participants more comfortable in the survey process. Special consideration can be given based on the sensitive subject matter. This could include extended time in answering questions, opting out of sensitive questions, and being able to revoke permission of survey at any given time.", "with_video": true, "completed_time": 1744979321230, "student": {"_id": "67ef6a7228462e6254493d39", "uid": "FRDC7PeiO6dMTKNiEdVn7IqTOzd2", "email": "anjale@uw.edu", "status": "onboarded", "created_at": 1743743602926, "intro_status": {"create": false, "view_assignment": false, "start_conversation": false, "evaluate": false}, "getting_started": {"try_conversation": false, "see_evaluation": false, "create_conversation": false}, "above_18": true, "checked": true, "max_conversations": 3, "name": "Anjali Einstein", "role": "student"}, "assignment": {"_id": "650887206bafa99931fc9801", "time_limit": true, "min_words": 10, "task_prompt": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "subject": "Social Science", "grade": 13, "recording_format": "with_video", "time_limit_seconds": 60, "assignment_type": "Student-Based Assignment", "title": "Students were asked to choose a concept and develop a conceptual and operational definition for the concept.", "external_format": null, "conversation_flow": [{"type": "start"}, {"type": "base", "level": 1, "concept": "Tell me about the concept that you chose and your process for developing the conceptual definition and the associated dimensions."}, {"type": "followup"}, {"type": "base", "level": 2, "concept": "Tell me about the process of developing an operational definition.

The first thing that stood out to me was absence, like loss. I feel that is the most direct aspect of grief. However, there's also the complexity of emotion. Initially, I was going to choose sadness as a dimension, but I realized that emotions are much more complex, and sadness is too simplified as a dimension. Physical toil is also really interesting because grief has tangible effects. A lot of people focus on the emotional state, the emotional reaction, or the tangible effects of losing someone, but not necessarily the physical effects and the toll it takes on the body.\n\nI mentioned complex emotional reasoning and used the Likert scale for my indicators. I believe this helps effectively measure the dimensions of grief because participants can track how strongly they relate to a statement. Those statements are designed as indicators, connected to a specific dimension. The indicators and dimensions help to grasp the overall concept of grief. Through these indicators, participants can measure their feelings in relation to the statements. The numerical representation of these indicators shows how people feel about certain aspects of grief. For instance, if an indicator for physical toil differs significantly from the numerical representation for loss, it indicates how different dimensions of grief affect people to various extents.\n\nWhen designing this development process, I did not prioritize the Likert scale for one dimension over another.

By designing indicators and ensuring they aligned with my dimension, I was able to ensure the reliability and validity of the definition. Designing the questions and statements, such as the Likert scale, to correctly resonate with the definition was crucial. Eventually, the chatbot approved both my definition and dimension separately, as well as my indicators, which reassured me. This meant I had correctly designed the dimensions and indicators. When I conducted a final test to determine their interrelation and passed, I realized that through all the revisions and processes, I consistently received approval from the chatbot. While I don't want to rely on the chatbot entirely, it helped me initially check my work and ensure reliability and validity. Consistently testing it out, going through the development process, and continuously tweaking the wording to avoid vagueness, double-barreling, and misinterpretation is essential in defining the terms and referencing specific parts of my essay."}, {"conversation_id": "68024097613e7c98b792c991", "question": "It's interesting how you emphasized using the chatbot for revising your definition and aligning it with your indicators.

I didn't really know how to design good statements for the scale because what seemed like common knowledge and very comprehensive to me turned out to not be easily or consistently interpretable among a wide range of audiences. I had to consistently use a chatbot to tweak even very small words\u2014something as simple as using \"and\" or \"or\" could sometimes ruin the whole statement. Specifying what I meant and avoiding double-barreled questions was one of the biggest challenges in my revision process. I also had to ensure that the words I used were not overly interpretable.\n\nFor example, I was discussing grief and the emotions that come with it. One of the earlier drafted questions I had was: \"With the experience of grief in a situation, I have experienced a wider range of emotions than I previously have on a daily basis.\" The phrase \"a wide range of emotions\" was pretty vague. Additionally, comparing it to \"previous emotions on a daily basis\" made it difficult for participants to answer easily. I had to ensure the questions were not so vague that they became difficult to interpret, which would make the numerical representation of responses inaccurate, as each person might focus on their very specific experiences rather than a general understanding of the question.\n\nThrough this revision process, I learned a lot about complex emotional reasoning. I realized that it is challenging to define and design a study or process that measures something so conceptual. I needed to ensure that my personal interpretation did not influence my indicators. I recognized the importance of approaching the concept from multiple angles rather than relying solely on my perspective of grief. Additionally, I learned to avoid making it too narrow or specific, steering clear of guiding respondents toward a particular answer. This process taught me how to broaden my scope, something I struggled with in the definition. Ultimately, I learned how to cover all bases of grief more effectively through the revision of the definition and the indicators in this case."}, {"conversation_id": "68024097613e7c98b792c991", "question": "Your approach to refining your indicators demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexity of grief. Now, consider this: What conclusions can you draw about the potential ethical implications of relying on a chatbot for feedback when designing sensitive research indicators related to emotional experiences like grief?", "question_num": 6, "uuid": "68ce989a-93f5-4703-9f52-abf09197a9d4", "created_at": 1744979321004, "response": "i would say chatbot really helped me start my foundation and it also really helped me learn the concepts the concepts are nothing without application and application in my opinion should always be ethical and in this class we are being taught about social justice research and the impact of it and how to like mindfully and ethically design experiments where we can put participants and in their best circumstances and make sure that we value them and respect them even if that process is a little bit longer or more complex and as much as i love using chatbot to really help me like hammer down the conceptual parts and the definitions and the indicators i do think it can be very limiting because my concept was grief and grief is something that is very personal it is very emotional it can be very sensitive and triggering to people it is definitely a concept that is not it is very common and is universal but it still remains very sensitive and i am not a tech expert by any means but i can also understand that for the most part technology and ai is not gonna be able to understand the complexity of human emotion the same way that a human is going to understand human emotion and so it is really important that when we are designing these processes that we are centering humor human centered design elements where we are putting humans first and we are understanding this from like a very human perspective using technology as a resource but not as a solution and i think chatbot also you know has a lot of positives i mean for one it is very accessible education a lot of times is very inaccessible to people it has become somewhat elitist and classist and so i think ai there is potential to provide more resources to people who may not have traditional classroom resources and so i think chatbot was probably one of the best tools that i have personally used in my work but i think in terms of like the actual design and implementation of this specific process specifically revolving around grief i don't think it can really contribute more than providing like conceptual foundations because when i was designing this i had to rely on how i felt and the sensitivity and the empathy that i wanna carry into my work and because of that i was able to design like the dimensions and the indicators trying to keep humans at the center of that whereas i think if i had relied on ai to do that it would be very impersonal and it would definitely like oh it would only maximize efficiency but not really care about the actual like experience of people in set process and that was kind of a long answer", "improved_response": "I would say the chatbot really helped me start my foundation, and it also significantly aided me in learning the concepts. Concepts are nothing without application, and, in my opinion, application should always be ethical. In this class, we are being taught about social justice research, its impact, and how to mindfully and ethically design experiments that place participants in the best possible circumstances, ensuring we value and respect them. Even if this process takes a little longer or is more complex, it remains essential.\n\nAs much as I love using the chatbot to help me master the conceptual parts, definitions, and indicators, I find it can be quite limiting. My concept was grief, which is very personal, emotional, and can be sensitive and triggering for people. Even though grief is a common and universal experience, it remains sensitive. I am not a tech expert by any means, but I can understand that technology and AI are generally not capable of comprehending the complexity of human emotion in the same way a human can. Therefore, when designing these processes, it is crucial that we focus on human-centered design elements, putting humans first and understanding from a human perspective, using technology as a resource but not as the sole solution.\n\nI think chatbots have numerous positives. For one, they are very accessible, while education is often very inaccessible and has become somewhat elitist and classist. AI has the potential to provide more resources to those who may not have access to traditional classroom resources. I believe the chatbot was one of the best tools I have personally used in my work. However, in terms of the actual design and implementation of processes specifically revolving around grief, I don't think it can contribute more than providing conceptual foundations. In designing this, I had to rely on my feelings, sensitivity, and the empathy I wanted to carry into my work. This approach allowed me to design dimensions and indicators with humans at the center, whereas relying solely on AI would result in a very impersonal process. It would maximize efficiency but not care about the actual experience of people in the process. \n\nThat was a rather long answer!"}]}}}
